  Modular Self-Reconfigurable Satellites</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Modular self-reconfigurable satellites refer to satellite clusters composed
of individual modular units capable of altering their configurations. The
configuration changes enable the execution of diverse tasks and mission
objectives. Existing path planning algorithms for reconfiguration often suffer
from high computational complexity, poor generalization capability, and limited
support for diverse target configurations. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a goal-oriented reinforcement learning-based path planning
algorithm. This algorithm is the first to address the challenge that previous
reinforcement learning methods failed to overcome, namely handling multiple
target configurations. Moreover, techniques such as Hindsight Experience Replay
and Invalid Action Masking are incorporated to overcome the significant
obstacles posed by sparse rewards and invalid actions. Based on these designs,
our model achieves a 95% and 73% success rate in reaching arbitrary target
configurations in a modular satellite cluster composed of four and six units,
respectively.</p>

  in Vehicular Networks</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Lingyi Wang, Rashed Shelim, Walid Saad, Naren Ramakrishnan</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-03 06:23:18</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based learning approaches for
wireless networks rely on expensive trial-and-error mechanisms and real-time
feedback based on extensive environment interactions, which leads to low data
efficiency and short-sighted policies. These limitations become particularly
problematic in complex, dynamic networks with high uncertainty and long-term
planning requirements. To address these limitations, in this paper, a novel
world model-based learning framework is proposed to minimize
packet-completeness-aware age of information (CAoI) in a vehicular network.
Particularly, a challenging representative scenario is considered pertaining to
a millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network,
which is characterized by high mobility, frequent signal blockages, and
extremely short coherence time. Then, a world model framework is proposed to
jointly learn a dynamic model of the mmWave V2X environment and use it to
imagine trajectories for learning how to perform link scheduling. In
particular, the long-term policy is learned in differentiable imagined
trajectories instead of environment interactions. Moreover, owing to its
imagination abilities, the world model can jointly predict time-varying
wireless data and optimize link scheduling in real-world wireless and V2X
networks. Thus, during intervals without actual observations, the world model
remains capable of making efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are
performed on a realistic simulator based on Sionna that integrates
physics-based end-to-end channel modeling, ray-tracing, and scene geometries
with material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model
achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency, and achieves 26%
improvement and 16% improvement in CAoI, respectively, compared to the
model-based RL (MBRL) method and the model-free RL (MFRL) method.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure safety when an RL agent
conducts learning by interacting with real-world environments where improper
actions can induce high costs or lead to severe consequences. In this paper, we
propose a novel Safe Skill Planning (SSkP) approach to enhance effective safe
RL by exploiting auxiliary offline demonstration data. SSkP involves a
two-stage process. First, we employ PU learning to learn a skill risk predictor
from the offline demonstration data. Then, based on the learned skill risk
predictor, we develop a novel risk planning process to enhance online safe RL
and learn a risk-averse safe policy efficiently through interactions with the
online RL environment, while simultaneously adapting the skill risk predictor
to the environment. We conduct experiments in several benchmark robotic
simulation environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art safe RL methods.</p>

  Explainable Control for Human-Centric Cooperation</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Jaehong Oh</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-02 17:08:23</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This is a preprint of a review article that has not yet undergone peer
review. The content is intended for early dissemination and academic
discussion. The final version may differ upon formal publication. As the Fourth
Industrial Revolution reshapes industrial paradigms, human-robot collaboration
(HRC) has transitioned from a desirable capability to an operational necessity.
In response, collaborative robots (Cobots) are evolving beyond repetitive tasks
toward adaptive, semantically informed interaction with humans and
environments. This paper surveys five foundational pillars enabling this
transformation: semantic-level perception, cognitive action planning,
explainable learning and control, safety-aware motion design, and multimodal
human intention recognition. We examine the role of semantic mapping in
transforming spatial data into meaningful context, and explore cognitive
planning frameworks that leverage this context for goal-driven decision-making.
Additionally, we analyze explainable reinforcement learning methods, including
policy distillation and attention mechanisms, which enhance interpretability
and trust. Safety is addressed through force-adaptive control and risk-aware
trajectory planning, while seamless human interaction is supported via gaze and
gesture-based intent recognition. Despite these advancements, challenges such
as perception-action disjunction, real-time explainability limitations, and
incomplete human trust persist. To address these, we propose a unified
Cognitive Synergy Architecture, integrating all modules into a cohesive
framework for truly human-centric cobot collaboration.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Efficient path planning in robotics, particularly within large-scale, dynamic
environments, remains a significant hurdle. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited
adaptability in dynamic scenarios hinder real-time deployment on edge devices.
We present SmallPlan -- a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to
train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning
tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate
across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs
are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not
only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them
aware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with
larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from
hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it
well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous
robotics.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how
chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance.
However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel
reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a
bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT
that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the
semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the
token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch
generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce
BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes
both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning
strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance
with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE
benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1. Code is available

<p class='card-text'>We introduce Phi-4-reasoning, a 14-billion parameter reasoning model that
achieves strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. Trained via supervised
fine-tuning of Phi-4 on carefully curated set of "teachable" prompts-selected
for the right level of complexity and diversity-and reasoning demonstrations
generated using o3-mini, Phi-4-reasoning generates detailed reasoning chains
that effectively leverage inference-time compute. We further develop
Phi-4-reasoning-plus, a variant enhanced through a short phase of outcome-based
reinforcement learning that offers higher performance by generating longer
reasoning traces. Across a wide range of reasoning tasks, both models
outperform significantly larger open-weight models such as
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B model and approach the performance levels of full
DeepSeek-R1 model. Our comprehensive evaluations span benchmarks in math and
scientific reasoning, coding, algorithmic problem solving, planning, and
spatial understanding. Interestingly, we observe a non-trivial transfer of
improvements to general-purpose benchmarks as well. In this report, we provide
insights into our training data, our training methodologies, and our
evaluations. We show that the benefit of careful data curation for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) extends to reasoning language models, and can be further
amplified by reinforcement learning (RL). Finally, our evaluation points to
opportunities for improving how we assess the performance and robustness of
reasoning models.</p>

  Optimizing Energy-Constrained Cooperative Routing with a DRL Framework</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Efficient mission planning for cooperative systems involving Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) requires addressing energy
constraints, scalability, and coordination challenges between agents. UAVs
excel in rapidly covering large areas but are constrained by limited battery
life, while UGVs, with their extended operational range and capability to serve
as mobile recharging stations, are hindered by slower speeds. This
heterogeneity makes coordination between UAVs and UGVs critical for achieving
optimal mission outcomes. In this work, we propose a scalable deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to address the energy-constrained
cooperative routing problem for multi-agent UAV-UGV teams, aiming to visit a
set of task points in minimal time with UAVs relying on UGVs for recharging
during the mission. The framework incorporates sortie-wise agent switching to
efficiently manage multiple agents, by allocating task points and coordinating
actions. Using an encoder-decoder transformer architecture, it optimizes routes
and recharging rendezvous for the UAV-UGV team in the task scenario. Extensive
computational experiments demonstrate the framework's superior performance over
heuristic methods and a DRL baseline, delivering significant improvements in
solution quality and runtime efficiency across diverse scenarios.
Generalization studies validate its robustness, while dynamic scenario
highlights its adaptability to real-time changes with a case study. This work
advances UAV-UGV cooperative routing by providing a scalable, efficient, and
robust solution for multi-agent mission planning.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-29 17:37:45</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Mechanical search (MS) in cluttered environments remains a significant
challenge for autonomous manipulators, requiring long-horizon planning and
robust state estimation under occlusions and partial observability. In this
work, we introduce XPG-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that enables
agents to efficiently perform MS tasks through explainable, priority-guided
decision-making based on raw sensory inputs. XPG-RL integrates a task-driven
action prioritization mechanism with a learned context-aware switching strategy
that dynamically selects from a discrete set of action primitives such as
target grasping, occlusion removal, and viewpoint adjustment. Within this
strategy, a policy is optimized to output adaptive threshold values that govern
the discrete selection among action primitives. The perception module fuses
RGB-D inputs with semantic and geometric features to produce a structured scene
representation for downstream decision-making. Extensive experiments in both
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that XPG-RL consistently
outperforms baseline methods in task success rates and motion efficiency,
achieving up to 4.5$\times$ higher efficiency in long-horizon tasks. These
results underscore the benefits of integrating domain knowledge with learnable
decision-making policies for robust and efficient robotic manipulation.</p>

  for Adaptive User Interfaces</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Daniel Gaspar-Figueiredo, Marta Fernández-Diego, Silvia Abrahão, Emilio Insfran</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-29 14:00:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Adaptive User Interfaces (AUI) play a crucial role in modern software
applications by dynamically adjusting interface elements to accommodate users'
diverse and evolving needs. However, existing adaptation strategies often lack
real-time responsiveness. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising approach for addressing complex, sequential adaptation challenges,
enabling adaptive systems to learn optimal policies based on previous
adaptation experiences. Although RL has been applied to AUIs,integrating RL
agents effectively within user interactions remains a challenge.
  In this paper, we enhance a RL-based Adaptive User Interface adaption
framework by incorporating personalized human feedback directly into the
leaning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a single pre-trained RL
model, our approach trains a unique RL agent for each user, allowing
individuals to actively shape their personal RL agent's policy, potentially
leading to more personalized and responsive UI adaptations. To evaluate this
approach, we conducted an empirical study to assess the impact of integrating
human feedback into the RL-based Adaptive User Interface adaption framework and
its effect on User Experience (UX). The study involved 33 participants
interacting with AUIs incorporating human feedback and non-adaptive user
interfaces in two domains: an e-learning platform and a trip-planning
application. The results suggest that incorporating human feedback into
RL-driven adaptations significantly enhances UX, offering promising directions
for advancing adaptive capabilities and user-centered design in AUIs.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-28 10:13:47</h6>
<p class='card-text'>SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) is a crucial component for
robotic systems, providing a map of an environment, the current location and
previous trajectory of a robot. While 3D LiDAR SLAM has received notable
improvements in recent years, 2D SLAM lags behind. Gradual drifts in odometry
and pose estimation inaccuracies hinder modern 2D LiDAR-odometry algorithms in
large complex environments. Dynamic robotic motion coupled with inherent
estimation based SLAM processes introduce noise and errors, degrading map
quality. Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) produces results that are often noisy and
unclear. This is due to the fact that evidence based mapping represents maps
according to uncertain observations. This is why OGMs are so popular in
exploration or navigation tasks. However, this also limits OGMs' effectiveness
for specific mapping based tasks such as floor plan creation in complex scenes.
To address this, we propose our novel Transformation and Translation Occupancy
Grid Mapping (TT-OGM). We adapt and enable accurate and robust pose estimation
techniques from 3D SLAM to the world of 2D and mitigate errors to improve map
quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We introduce a novel data
generation method via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to build datasets large
enough for training a GAN for SLAM error correction. We demonstrate our SLAM in
real-time on data collected at Loughborough University. We also prove its
generalisability on a variety of large complex environments on a collection of
large scale well-known 2D occupancy maps. Our novel approach enables the
creation of high quality OGMs in complex scenes, far surpassing the
capabilities of current SLAM algorithms in terms of quality, accuracy and
reliability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We investigate reinforcement learning (RL) for privileged planning in
autonomous driving. State-of-the-art approaches for this task are rule-based,
but these methods do not scale to the long tail. RL, on the other hand, is
scalable and does not suffer from compounding errors like imitation learning.
Contemporary RL approaches for driving use complex shaped rewards that sum
multiple individual rewards, \eg~progress, position, or orientation rewards. We
show that PPO fails to optimize a popular version of these rewards when the
mini-batch size is increased, which limits the scalability of these approaches.
Instead, we propose a new reward design based primarily on optimizing a single
intuitive reward term: route completion. Infractions are penalized by
terminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion. We find
that PPO scales well with higher mini-batch sizes when trained with our simple
reward, even improving performance. Training with large mini-batch sizes
enables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism. We scale PPO to
300M samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node. The
resulting model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark,
outperforming other RL methods with more complex rewards by a large margin.
Requiring only minimal adaptations from its use in CARLA, the same method is
the best learning-based approach on nuPlan. It scores 91.3 in non-reactive and
90.6 in reactive traffic on the Val14 benchmark while being an order of
magnitude faster than prior work.</p>

properties using an RL kinematic controller for motion planning and a local
controller for actuation refinement, leveraging minimal sensing with visual
feedback. Trained entirely in simulation, the RL controller achieved a 99.8%
success rate. When deployed on hardware, it achieved a 67% success rate in
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, demonstrating robustness and adaptability. This
approach offers a scalable solution for SCAs in 3D visual servoing, with
potential for further refinement and expanded applications.</p>

  Agents</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Text-based games provide valuable environments for language-based autonomous
agents. However, planning-then-learning paradigms, such as those combining
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and reinforcement learning (RL), are notably
time-consuming due to extensive iterations. Additionally, these algorithms
perform uncertainty-driven exploration but lack language understanding and
reasoning abilities. In this paper, we introduce the Monte Carlo planning with
Dynamic Memory-guided Large language model (MC-DML) algorithm. MC-DML leverages
the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) alongside the exploratory advantages of tree search algorithms.
Specifically, we enhance LLMs with in-trial and cross-trial memory mechanisms,
enabling them to learn from past experiences and dynamically adjust action
evaluations during planning. We conduct experiments on a series of text-based
games from the Jericho benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the MC-DML
algorithm significantly enhances performance across various games at the
initial planning phase, outperforming strong contemporary methods that require
multiple iterations. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm,
paving the way for more efficient language-grounded planning in complex
environments.</p>

  Learning for Strategic Confrontation</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Qizhen Wu, Lei Chen, Kexin Liu, Jinhu Lü</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-22 13:22:58</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In swarm robotics, confrontation scenarios, including strategic
confrontations, require efficient decision-making that integrates discrete
commands and continuous actions. Traditional task and motion planning methods
separate decision-making into two layers, but their unidirectional structure
fails to capture the interdependence between these layers, limiting
adaptability in dynamic environments. Here, we propose a novel bidirectional
approach based on hierarchical reinforcement learning, enabling dynamic
interaction between the layers. This method effectively maps commands to task
allocation and actions to path planning, while leveraging cross-training
techniques to enhance learning across the hierarchical framework. Furthermore,
we introduce a trajectory prediction model that bridges abstract task
representations with actionable planning goals. In our experiments, it achieves
over 80% in confrontation win rate and under 0.01 seconds in decision time,
outperforming existing approaches. Demonstrations through large-scale tests and
real-world robot experiments further emphasize the generalization capabilities
and practical applicability of our method.</p>

  Learning and Reality Deployment</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Deploying robot learning methods to a quadrotor in unstructured outdoor
environments is an exciting task. Quadrotors operating in real-world
environments by learning-based methods encounter several challenges: a large
amount of simulator generated data required for training, strict demands for
real-time processing onboard, and the sim-to-real gap caused by dynamic and
noisy conditions. Current works have made a great breakthrough in applying
learning-based methods to end-to-end control of quadrotors, but rarely mention
the infrastructure system training from scratch and deploying to reality, which
makes it difficult to reproduce methods and applications. To bridge this gap,
we propose a platform that enables the seamless transfer of end-to-end deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We integrate the training environment,
flight dynamics control, DRL algorithms, the MAVROS middleware stack, and
hardware into a comprehensive workflow and architecture that enables
quadrotors' policies to be trained from scratch to real-world deployment in
several minutes. Our platform provides rich types of environments including
hovering, dynamic obstacle avoidance, trajectory tracking, balloon hitting, and
planning in unknown environments, as a physical experiment benchmark. Through
extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate the efficiency of proposed
sim-to-real platform, and robust outdoor flight performance under real-world
perturbations. Details can be found from our website

<p class='card-text'>This paper develops a novel unmanned surface vehicle (USV)-autonomous
underwater vehicle (AUV) collaborative system designed to enhance underwater
task performance in extreme sea conditions. The system integrates a dual
strategy: (1) high-precision multi-AUV localization enabled by Fisher
information matrix-optimized USV path planning, and (2) reinforcement
learning-based cooperative planning and control method for multi-AUV task
execution. Extensive experimental evaluations in the underwater data collection
task demonstrate the system's operational feasibility, with quantitative
results showing significant performance improvements over baseline methods. The
proposed system exhibits robust coordination capabilities between USV and AUVs
