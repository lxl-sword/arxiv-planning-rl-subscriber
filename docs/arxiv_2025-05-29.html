  in HDDL with OpenAI Gym</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Ngoc La, Ruaridh Mon-Williams, Julie A. Shah</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-28 17:10:43</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been widely tested
using tools like OpenAI Gym, though many tasks in these environments could also
benefit from hierarchical planning. However, there is a lack of a tool that
enables seamless integration of hierarchical planning with RL. Hierarchical
Domain Definition Language (HDDL), used in classical planning, introduces a
structured approach well-suited for model-based RL to address this gap. To
bridge this integration, we introduce HDDLGym, a Python-based tool that
automatically generates OpenAI Gym environments from HDDL domains and problems.
HDDLGym serves as a link between RL and hierarchical planning, supporting
multi-agent scenarios and enabling collaborative planning among agents. This
paper provides an overview of HDDLGym's design and implementation, highlighting
the challenges and design choices involved in integrating HDDL with the Gym
interface, and applying RL policies to support hierarchical planning. We also
provide detailed instructions and demonstrations for using the HDDLGym
framework, including how to work with existing HDDL domains and problems from
International Planning Competitions, exemplified by the Transport domain.
Additionally, we offer guidance on creating new HDDL domains for multi-agent
scenarios and demonstrate the practical use of HDDLGym in the Overcooked
domain. By leveraging the advantages of HDDL and Gym, HDDLGym aims to be a
valuable tool for studying RL in hierarchical planning, particularly in
multi-agent contexts.</p>

  Communications with AoI</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Chi Lu, Yiyang Ni, Zhe Wang, Xiaoli Shi, Jun Li, Shi Jin</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-28 09:41:10</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Decision Transformer (DT) has recently demonstrated strong generalizability
in dynamic resource allocation within unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks,
compared to conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, its
performance is hindered due to zero-padding for varying state dimensions,
inability to manage long-term energy constraint, and challenges in acquiring
expert samples for few-shot fine-tuning in new scenarios. To overcome these
limitations, we propose an attention-enhanced prompt Decision Transformer
(APDT) framework to optimize trajectory planning and user scheduling, aiming to
minimize the average age of information (AoI) under long-term energy constraint
in UAV-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Specifically, we enhance the
convenional DT framework by incorporating an attention mechanism to accommodate
varying numbers of terrestrial users, introducing a prompt mechanism based on
short trajectory demonstrations for rapid adaptation to new scenarios, and
designing a token-assisted method to address the UAV's long-term energy
constraint. The APDT framework is first pre-trained on offline datasets and
then efficiently generalized to new scenarios. Simulations demonstrate that
APDT achieves twice faster in terms of convergence rate and reduces average AoI
by $8\%$ compared to conventional DT.</p>

  Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-28 08:17:57</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has shown promise in
mitigating hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge during generation. Existing MRAG methods
typically adopt a static retrieval pipeline that fetches relevant information
from multiple Knowledge Bases (KBs), followed by a refinement step. However,
these approaches overlook the reasoning and planning capabilities of MLLMs to
dynamically determine how to interact with different KBs during the reasoning
process. To address this limitation, we propose R1-Router, a novel MRAG
framework that learns to decide when and where to retrieve knowledge based on
the evolving reasoning state. Specifically, R1-Router can generate follow-up
queries according to the current reasoning step, routing these intermediate
queries to the most suitable KB, and integrating external knowledge into a
coherent reasoning trajectory to answer the original query. Furthermore, we
introduce Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), a tailored
reinforcement learning algorithm that assigns step-specific rewards to optimize
the reasoning behavior of MLLMs. Experimental results on various open-domain QA
benchmarks across multiple modalities demonstrate that R1-Router outperforms
baseline models by over 7%. Further analysis shows that R1-Router can
adaptively and effectively leverage diverse KBs, reducing unnecessary
retrievals and improving both efficiency and accuracy.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-28 08:17:16</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We propose ReinFlow, a simple yet effective online reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that fine-tunes a family of flow matching policies for
continuous robotic control. Derived from rigorous RL theory, ReinFlow injects
learnable noise into a flow policy's deterministic path, converting the flow
into a discrete-time Markov Process for exact and straightforward likelihood
computation. This conversion facilitates exploration and ensures training
stability, enabling ReinFlow to fine-tune diverse flow model variants,
including Rectified Flow [35] and Shortcut Models [19], particularly at very
few or even one denoising step. We benchmark ReinFlow in representative
locomotion and manipulation tasks, including long-horizon planning with visual
input and sparse reward. The episode reward of Rectified Flow policies obtained
an average net growth of 135.36% after fine-tuning in challenging legged
locomotion tasks while saving denoising steps and 82.63% of wall time compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion RL fine-tuning method DPPO [43]. The success rate
of the Shortcut Model policies in state and visual manipulation tasks achieved
an average net increase of 40.34% after fine-tuning with ReinFlow at four or
even one denoising step, whose performance is comparable to fine-tuned DDIM
policies while saving computation time for an average of 23.20%. Project

<p class='card-text'>Despite advances in reasoning and planning of R1-like models, Large Language
Models (LLMs) still struggle with tasks requiring precise computation, symbolic
manipulation, optimization, and algorithmic reasoning, in which textual
reasoning lacks the rigor of code execution. A key challenge is enabling LLMs
to decide when to use textual reasoning versus code generation. While OpenAI
trains models to invoke a Code Interpreter as needed, public research lacks
guidance on aligning pre-trained LLMs to effectively leverage code and
generalize across diverse tasks. We present R1-Code-Interpreter, an extension
of a text-only LLM trained via multi-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously generate multiple code queries
during step-by-step reasoning. We curate 144 reasoning and planning tasks (107
for training, 37 for testing), each with over 200 diverse questions. We
fine-tune Qwen-2.5 models (3B/7B/14B) using various SFT and RL strategies,
investigating different answer formats, reasoning vs. non-reasoning models,
cold vs. warm starts, GRPO vs. PPO, and masked vs. unmasked code outputs.
Unlike prior RL work on narrow domains, we find that Code Interpreter training
is significantly harder due to high task diversity and expensive code
execution, highlighting the critical role of the SFT stage. Our final model,
R1-CI-14B, improves average accuracy on the 37 test tasks from 44.0\% to
64.1\%, outperforming GPT-4o (text-only: 58.6\%) and approaching GPT-4o with
Code Interpreter (70.9\%), with the emergent self-checking behavior via code
generation. Datasets, Codes, and Models are available at

  Perception via GRPO</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Active vision, also known as active perception, refers to the process of
actively selecting where and how to look in order to gather task-relevant
information. It is a critical component of efficient perception and
decision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and
decision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention.
However, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence,
there is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn
active perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic
definition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the
recently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a
special case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search
efficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose
ACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on
top of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We
further establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across
both general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding,
and domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote
sensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive
segmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot
reasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit
reasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and
evaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in
MLLMs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited extraordinary performance in a
variety of tasks while it remains challenging for them to solve complex
multi-step tasks as agents. In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of
certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle
mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the
reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every
reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models
(PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number
of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire
the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this
issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps
and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for
process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO).
Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until
identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising
rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands
the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing
high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on
the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO
achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-26 23:14:16</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in various
robot control tasks. However, their deployment in real-world applications
remains constrained. Even state-ofthe-art LLMs, such as GPT-o4mini, frequently
produce invalid action plans that violate physical constraints, such as
directing a robot to an unreachable location or causing collisions between
robots. This issue primarily arises from a lack of awareness of these physical
constraints during the reasoning process. To address this issue, we propose a
novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) to incentivize knowledge of physical constraints into LLMs to induce
constraints-aware reasoning during plan generation. In this approach, only
valid action plans that successfully complete a control task receive positive
rewards. We applied our method to two small-scale LLMs: a non-reasoning
Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and a reasoning Qwen3-4B. The experiment results
demonstrate that constraint-aware small LLMs largely outperform large-scale
models without constraints, grounded on both the BoxNet task and a newly
developed BoxNet3D environment built using MuJoCo. This work highlights the
effectiveness of grounding even small LLMs with physical constraints to enable
scalable and efficient multi-robot control in complex, physically constrained
environments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) represent a classic paradigm
where models enhance generative capabilities using external knowledge retrieved
via a specialized module. Recent advancements in Agent techniques enable Large
Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously utilize tools for retrieval, planning,
and reasoning. While existing training-based methods show promise, their
agentic abilities are limited by inherent characteristics of the task-specific
data used during training. To further enhance the universal search capability
of agents, we propose a novel pre-training framework, MaskSearch. In the
pre-training stage, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Mask Prediction (RAMP)
task, where the model learns to leverage search tools to fill masked spans on a
large number of pre-training data, thus acquiring universal retrieval and
reasoning capabilities for LLMs. After that, the model is trained on downstream
tasks to achieve further improvement. We apply both Supervised Fine-tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training. For SFT, we combine
agent-based and distillation-based methods to generate training data, starting
with a multi-agent system consisting of a planner, rewriter, observer, and
followed by a self-evolving teacher model. While for RL, we employ DAPO as the
training framework and adopt a hybrid reward system consisting of answer
rewards and format rewards. Additionally, we introduce a curriculum learning
approach that allows the model to learn progressively from easier to more
challenging instances based on the number of masked spans. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our framework in the scenario of open-domain multi-hop
question answering. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
MaskSearch significantly enhances the performance of LLM-based search agents on
both in-domain and out-of-domain downstream tasks.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-26 16:15:42</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Collision-free motion planning for redundant robot manipulators in complex
environments is yet to be explored. Although recent advancements at the
intersection of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and robotics have highlighted
its potential to handle versatile robotic tasks, current DRL-based
collision-free motion planners for manipulators are highly costly, hindering
their deployment and application. This is due to an overreliance on the minimum
distance between the manipulator and obstacles, inadequate exploration and
decision-making by DRL, and inefficient data acquisition and utilization. In
this article, we propose URPlanner, a universal paradigm for collision-free
robotic motion planning based on DRL. URPlanner offers several advantages over
existing approaches: it is platform-agnostic, cost-effective in both training
and deployment, and applicable to arbitrary manipulators without solving
inverse kinematics. To achieve this, we first develop a parameterized task
space and a universal obstacle avoidance reward that is independent of minimum
distance. Second, we introduce an augmented policy exploration and evaluation
algorithm that can be applied to various DRL algorithms to enhance their
performance. Third, we propose an expert data diffusion strategy for efficient
policy learning, which can produce a large-scale trajectory dataset from only a
few expert demonstrations. Finally, the superiority of the proposed methods is
comprehensively verified through experiments.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Eric Zhao, Jessica Dai, Pranjal Awasthi</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-26 13:26:15</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Recent progress in strengthening the capabilities of large language models
has stemmed from applying reinforcement learning to domains with automatically
verifiable outcomes. A key question is whether we can similarly use RL to
optimize for outcomes in domains where evaluating outcomes inherently requires
human feedback; for example, in tasks like deep research and trip planning,
outcome evaluation is qualitative and there are many possible degrees of
success. One attractive and scalable modality for collecting human feedback is
preference data: ordinal rankings (pairwise or $k$-wise) that indicate, for $k$
given outcomes, which one is preferred. In this work, we study a critical
roadblock: preference data fundamentally and significantly limits outcome-based
optimization. Even with idealized preference data (infinite, noiseless, and
online), the use of ordinal feedback can prevent obtaining even approximately
optimal solutions. We formalize this impossibility using voting theory, drawing
an analogy between how a model chooses to answer a query with how voters choose
a candidate to elect. This indicates that grounded human scoring and
algorithmic innovations are necessary for extending the success of RL
post-training to domains demanding human feedback. We also explore why these
limitations have disproportionately impacted RLHF when it comes to eliciting
reasoning behaviors (e.g., backtracking) versus situations where RLHF has been
historically successful (e.g., instruction-tuning and safety training), finding
that the limitations of preference data primarily suppress RLHF's ability to
elicit robust strategies -- a class that encompasses most reasoning behaviors.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-26 11:50:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>With the recent success of world-model agents, which extend the core idea of
model-based reinforcement learning by learning a differentiable model for
sample-efficient control across diverse tasks, active inference (AIF) offers a
complementary, neuroscience-grounded paradigm that unifies perception,
learning, and action within a single probabilistic framework powered by a
generative model. Despite this promise, practical AIF agents still rely on
accurate immediate predictions and exhaustive planning, a limitation that is
exacerbated in delayed environments requiring plans over long horizons, tens to
hundreds of steps. Moreover, most existing agents are evaluated on robotic or
vision benchmarks which, while natural for biological agents, fall short of
real-world industrial complexity. We address these limitations with a
generative-policy architecture featuring (i) a multi-step latent transition
that lets the generative model predict an entire horizon in a single
look-ahead, (ii) an integrated policy network that enables the transition and
receives gradients of the expected free energy, (iii) an alternating
optimization scheme that updates model and policy from a replay buffer, and
(iv) a single gradient step that plans over long horizons, eliminating
exhaustive planning from the control loop. We evaluate our agent in an
environment that mimics a realistic industrial scenario with delayed and
long-horizon settings. The empirical results confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, demonstrating the coupled world-model with the AIF formalism
yields an end-to-end probabilistic controller capable of effective decision
making in delayed, long-horizon settings without handcrafted rewards or
expensive planning.</p>

learning, and hybrid strategies). Through systematic analysis of experimental
practices across 200+ papers, we uncover significant disparities in evaluation
methodologies, with classical methods typically tested on larger-scale
instances (up to 200 by 200 grids with 1000+ agents) compared to learning-based
approaches (predominantly 10-100 agents). We provide a comprehensive taxonomy
of evaluation metrics, environment types, and baseline selections, highlighting
the need for standardized benchmarking protocols. Finally, we outline promising
future directions including mixed-motive MAPF with game-theoretic
considerations, language-grounded planning with large language models, and
neural solver architectures that combine the rigor of classical methods with
the flexibility of deep learning. This survey serves as both a comprehensive
reference for researchers and a practical guide for deploying MAPF solutions in
increasingly complex real-world applications.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly applied to real-world problems
involving complex and structured decisions, such as routing, scheduling, and
assortment planning. These settings challenge standard RL algorithms, which
struggle to scale, generalize, and exploit structure in the presence of
combinatorial action spaces. We propose Structured Reinforcement Learning
(SRL), a novel actor-critic framework that embeds combinatorial optimization
layers into the actor neural network. We enable end-to-end learning of the
actor via Fenchel-Young losses and provide a geometric interpretation of SRL as
a primal-dual algorithm in the dual of the moment polytope. Across six
environments with exogenous and endogenous uncertainty, SRL matches or
surpasses the performance of unstructured RL and imitation learning on static
tasks and improves over these baselines by up to 92% on dynamic problems, with
improved stability and convergence speed.</p>

  Liver Tumours</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Catalina Tan, Yipeng Hu, Shaheer U. Saeed</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate tumour segmentation is vital for various targeted diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures for cancer, e.g., planning biopsies or tumour ablations.
Manual delineation is extremely labour-intensive, requiring substantial expert
time. Fully-supervised machine learning models aim to automate such
localisation tasks, but require a large number of costly and often subjective
3D voxel-level labels for training. The high-variance and subjectivity in such
labels impacts model generalisability, even when large datasets are available.
Histopathology labels may offer more objective labels but the infeasibility of
acquiring pixel-level annotations to develop tumour localisation methods based
on histology remains challenging in-vivo. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised semantic segmentation framework called SPARS (Self-Play
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Segmentation), which utilises an object
presence classifier, trained on a small number of image-level binary cancer
presence labels, to localise cancerous regions on CT scans. Such binary labels
of patient-level cancer presence can be sourced more feasibly from biopsies and
histopathology reports, enabling a more objective cancer localisation on
medical images. Evaluating with real patient data, we observed that SPARS
yielded a mean dice score of $77.3 \pm 9.4$, which outperformed other
weakly-supervised methods by large margins. This performance was comparable
with recent fully-supervised methods that require voxel-level annotations. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using SPARS to reduce the need for
extensive human-annotated labels to detect cancer in real-world healthcare
settings.</p>

  through Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Jinzheng Li, Sibo Ju, Yanzhou Su, Hongguang Li, Yiqing Shen</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Existing large language models (LLMs) driven search agents typically rely on
prompt engineering to decouple the user queries into search plans, limiting
their effectiveness in complex scenarios requiring reasoning. Furthermore, they
suffer from excessive token consumption due to Python-based search plan
representations and inadequate integration of multimedia elements for both
input processing and response generation. To address these challenges, we
introduce SearchExpert, a training method for LLMs to improve their multimedia
search capabilities in response to complex search queries. Firstly, we
reformulate the search plan in an efficient natural language representation to
reduce token consumption. Then, we propose the supervised fine-tuning for
searching (SFTS) to fine-tune LLM to adapt to these representations, together
with an automated dataset construction pipeline. Secondly, to improve
reasoning-intensive search capabilities, we propose the reinforcement learning
from search feedback (RLSF) that takes the search results planned by LLM as the
reward signals. Thirdly, we propose a multimedia understanding and generation
agent that enables the fine-tuned LLM to process visual input and produce
visual output during inference. Finally, we establish an automated benchmark
construction pipeline and a human evaluation framework. Our resulting
benchmark, SearchExpertBench-25, comprises 200 multiple-choice questions
spanning financial and international news scenarios that require reasoning in
searching. Experiments demonstrate that SearchExpert outperforms the commercial
LLM search method (Perplexity Pro) by 36.60% on the existing FinSearchBench-24
benchmark and 54.54% on our proposed SearchExpertBench-25. Human evaluations
further confirm the superior readability.</p>

  Goal-Conditioned RL</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Joey Hong, Anca Dragan, Sergey Levine</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-23 16:51:54</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks like question answering and
dialogue, but complex tasks requiring interaction, such as negotiation and
persuasion, require additional long-horizon reasoning and planning.
Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning can enable such planning in principle,
but suffers from drawbacks that hinder scalability. In particular, multi-turn
RL training incurs high memory and computational costs, which are exacerbated
when training LLMs as policies. Furthermore, the largest LLMs do not expose the
APIs necessary to be trained in such manner. As a result, modern methods to
improve the reasoning of LLMs rely on sophisticated prompting mechanisms rather
than RL fine-tuning. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach that uses
goal-conditioned value functions to guide the reasoning of LLM agents, that
scales even to large API-based models. These value functions predict how a task
will unfold given an action, allowing the LLM agent to evaluate multiple
possible outcomes, both positive and negative, to plan effectively. In
addition, these value functions are trained over reasoning steps rather than
full actions, to be a concise and light-weight module that facilitates
decision-making in multi-turn interactions. We validate our method on tasks
requiring interaction, including tool use, social deduction, and dialogue,
demonstrating superior performance over both RL fine-tuning and prompting
methods while maintaining efficiency and scalability.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Quentin Clark, Florian Shkurti</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-23 16:41:08</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In planning, stitching is an ability of algorithms to piece together
sub-trajectories of data they are trained on to generate new and diverse
behaviours. While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement
learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown
proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly
understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably
stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties
are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local
receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and
inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion
planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling.
Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than
positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition,
both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple
architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive
methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based
guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable
generalization in goal-conditioned settings.</p>
