  Simulation Environments</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Luke Rowe, Roger Girgis, Anthony Gosselin, Liam Paull, Christopher Pal, Felix Heide</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-28 15:03:41</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We introduce Scenario Dreamer, a fully data-driven generative simulator for
autonomous vehicle planning that generates both the initial traffic scene -
comprising a lane graph and agent bounding boxes - and closed-loop agent
behaviours. Existing methods for generating driving simulation environments
encode the initial traffic scene as a rasterized image and, as such, require
parameter-heavy networks that perform unnecessary computation due to many empty
pixels in the rasterized scene. Moreover, we find that existing methods that
employ rule-based agent behaviours lack diversity and realism. Scenario Dreamer
instead employs a novel vectorized latent diffusion model for initial scene
generation that directly operates on the vectorized scene elements and an
autoregressive Transformer for data-driven agent behaviour simulation. Scenario
Dreamer additionally supports scene extrapolation via diffusion inpainting,
enabling the generation of unbounded simulation environments. Extensive
experiments show that Scenario Dreamer outperforms existing generative
simulators in realism and efficiency: the vectorized scene-generation base
model achieves superior generation quality with around 2x fewer parameters, 6x
lower generation latency, and 10x fewer GPU training hours compared to the
strongest baseline. We confirm its practical utility by showing that
reinforcement learning planning agents are more challenged in Scenario Dreamer
environments than traditional non-generative simulation environments,
especially on long and adversarial driving environments.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-28 05:57:23</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Multi-Agent Pathfinding is used in areas including multi-robot formations,
warehouse logistics, and intelligent vehicles. However, many environments are
incomplete or frequently change, making it difficult for standard centralized
planning or pure reinforcement learning to maintain both global solution
quality and local flexibility. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that
integrates D* Lite global search with multi-agent reinforcement learning, using
a switching mechanism and a freeze-prevention strategy to handle dynamic
conditions and crowded settings. We evaluate the framework in the discrete
POGEMA environment and compare it with baseline methods. Experimental outcomes
indicate that the proposed framework substantially improves success rate,
collision rate, and path efficiency. The model is further tested on the EyeSim
platform, where it maintains feasible Pathfinding under frequent changes and
large-scale robot deployments.</p>

  Contact-Rich Robotic Tasks</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Heng Zhang, Gokhan Solak, Arash Ajoudani</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-27 21:11:32</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Ensuring safety in reinforcement learning (RL)-based robotic systems is a
critical challenge, especially in contact-rich tasks within unstructured
environments. While the state-of-the-art safe RL approaches mitigate risks
through safe exploration or high-level recovery mechanisms, they often overlook
low-level execution safety, where reflexive responses to potential hazards are
crucial. Similarly, variable impedance control (VIC) enhances safety by
adjusting the robot's mechanical response, yet lacks a systematic way to adapt
parameters, such as stiffness and damping throughout the task. In this paper,
we propose Bresa, a Bio-inspired Reflexive Hierarchical Safe RL method inspired
by biological reflexes. Our method decouples task learning from safety
learning, incorporating a safety critic network that evaluates action risks and
operates at a higher frequency than the task solver. Unlike existing
recovery-based methods, our safety critic functions at a low-level control
layer, allowing real-time intervention when unsafe conditions arise. The
task-solving RL policy, running at a lower frequency, focuses on high-level
planning (decision-making), while the safety critic ensures instantaneous
safety corrections. We validate Bresa on multiple tasks including a
contact-rich robotic task, demonstrating its reflexive ability to enhance
safety, and adaptability in unforeseen dynamic environments. Our results show
that Bresa outperforms the baseline, providing a robust and reflexive safety
mechanism that bridges the gap between high-level planning and low-level
execution. Real-world experiments and supplementary material are available at

  Vision-Language-Guided Closed-Loop Feedback</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-27 20:32:58</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Recent advances in language-conditioned robotic manipulation have leveraged
imitation and reinforcement learning to enable robots to execute tasks from
human commands. However, these methods often suffer from limited
generalization, adaptability, and the lack of large-scale specialized datasets,
unlike data-rich domains such as computer vision, making long-horizon task
execution challenging. To address these gaps, we introduce DAHLIA, a
data-agnostic framework for language-conditioned long-horizon robotic
manipulation, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for real-time task
planning and execution. DAHLIA employs a dual-tunnel architecture, where an
LLM-powered planner collaborates with co-planners to decompose tasks and
generate executable plans, while a reporter LLM provides closed-loop feedback,
enabling adaptive re-planning and ensuring task recovery from potential
failures. Moreover, DAHLIA integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) in task reasoning
and temporal abstraction for efficient action execution, enhancing traceability
and robustness. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across
diverse long-horizon tasks, achieving strong generalization in both simulated
and real-world scenarios. Videos and code are available at

  with Self-Play and Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Hui Wang</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-27 16:52:25</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant
advancements in natural language processing (NLP), with strong capa-bilities in
generation, comprehension, and rea-soning. These models have found applications
in education, intelligent decision-making, and gaming. However, effectively
utilizing LLMs for strategic planning and decision-making in the game of Gomoku
remains a challenge. This study aims to develop a Gomoku AI system based on
LLMs, simulating the human learning process of playing chess. The system is
de-signed to understand and apply Gomoku strat-egies and logic to make rational
decisions. The research methods include enabling the model to "read the board,"
"understand the rules," "select strategies," and "evaluate positions," while
en-hancing its abilities through self-play and rein-forcement learning. The
results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the se-lection of
move positions, resolves the issue of generating illegal positions, and reduces
pro-cess time through parallel position evaluation. After extensive self-play
training, the model's Gomoku-playing capabilities have been notably enhanced.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Olivier Serris, St√©phane Doncieux, Olivier Sigaud</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-27 16:47:46</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Several hierarchical reinforcement learning methods leverage planning to
create a graph or sequences of intermediate goals, guiding a lower-level
goal-conditioned (GC) policy to reach some final goals. The low-level policy is
typically conditioned on the current goal, with the aim of reaching it as
quickly as possible. However, this approach can fail when an intermediate goal
can be reached in multiple ways, some of which may make it impossible to
continue toward subsequent goals. To address this issue, we introduce two
instances of Markov Decision Process (MDP) where the optimization objective
favors policies that not only reach the current goal but also subsequent ones.
In the first, the agent is conditioned on both the current and final goals,
while in the second, it is conditioned on the next two goals in the sequence.
We conduct a series of experiments on navigation and pole-balancing tasks in
which sequences of intermediate goals are given. By evaluating policies trained
with TD3+HER on both the standard GC-MDP and our proposed MDPs, we show that,
in most cases, conditioning on the next two goals improves stability and sample
efficiency over other approaches.</p>

  Ultrasound</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Yuhao Huang, Ao Chang, Haoran Dou, Xing Tao, Xinrui Zhou, Yan Cao, Ruobing Huang, Alejandro F Frangi, Lingyun Bao, Xin Yang, Dong Ni</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-26 16:20:02</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Accurate segmentation of nodules in both 2D breast ultrasound (BUS) and 3D
automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is crucial for clinical diagnosis and
treatment planning. Therefore, developing an automated system for nodule
segmentation can enhance user independence and expedite clinical analysis.
Unlike fully-supervised learning, weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) can
streamline the laborious and intricate annotation process. However, current WSS
methods face challenges in achieving precise nodule segmentation, as many of
them depend on inaccurate activation maps or inefficient pseudo-mask generation
algorithms. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement
learning-based WSS framework called Flip Learning, which relies solely on 2D/3D
boxes for accurate segmentation. Specifically, multiple agents are employed to
erase the target from the box to facilitate classification tag flipping, with
the erased region serving as the predicted segmentation mask. The key
contributions of this research are as follows: (1) Adoption of a
superpixel/supervoxel-based approach to encode the standardized environment,
capturing boundary priors and expediting the learning process. (2) Introduction
of three meticulously designed rewards, comprising a classification score
reward and two intensity distribution rewards, to steer the agents' erasing
process precisely, thereby avoiding both under- and over-segmentation. (3)
Implementation of a progressive curriculum learning strategy to enable agents
to interact with the environment in a progressively challenging manner, thereby
enhancing learning efficiency. Extensively validated on the large in-house BUS
and ABUS datasets, our Flip Learning method outperforms state-of-the-art WSS
methods and foundation models, and achieves comparable performance as
fully-supervised learning algorithms.</p>

  Placement and Migration in Hybrid Storage Systems</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Hybrid storage systems (HSS) combine multiple storage devices with diverse
characteristics to achieve high performance and capacity at low cost. The
performance of an HSS highly depends on the effectiveness of two key policies:
(1) the data-placement policy, which determines the best-fit storage device for
incoming data, and (2) the data-migration policy, which rearranges stored data
across the devices to sustain high HSS performance. Prior works focus on
improving only data placement or only data migration in HSS, which leads to
sub-optimal HSS performance. Unfortunately, no prior work tries to optimize
both policies together. Our goal is to design a holistic data-management
technique for HSS that optimizes both data-placement and data-migration
policies to fully exploit the potential of an HSS. We propose Harmonia, a
multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based data-management technique that
employs two light-weight autonomous RL agents, a data-placement agent and a
data-migration agent, which adapt their policies for the current workload and
HSS configuration, and coordinate with each other to improve overall HSS
performance. We evaluate Harmonia on a real HSS with up to four heterogeneous
storage devices with diverse characteristics. Our evaluation using 17
data-intensive workloads on performance-optimized (cost-optimized) HSS with two
storage devices shows that, on average, Harmonia (1) outperforms the
best-performing prior approach by 49.5% (31.7%), (2) bridges the performance
gap between the best-performing prior work and Oracle by 64.2% (64.3%). On an
HSS with three (four) devices, Harmonia outperforms the best-performing prior
work by 37.0% (42.0%). Harmonia's performance benefits come with low latency
(240ns for inference) and storage overheads (206 KiB for both RL agents
together). We plan to open-source Harmonia's implementation to aid future
research on HSS.</p>

  Socially-Aware Robot Navigation</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-26 10:59:08</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Navigating in environments alongside humans requires agents to reason under
uncertainty and account for the beliefs and intentions of those around them.
Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can
naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social
navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others,
inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP),
where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of
Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based
reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the
challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a
perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on
Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.</p>

  Learning</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-26 01:07:35</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has demonstrated superior sample
efficiency compared to model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). However, the
presence of inaccurate models can introduce biases during policy learning,
resulting in misleading trajectories. The challenge lies in obtaining accurate
models due to limited diverse training data, particularly in regions with
limited visits (uncertain regions). Existing approaches passively quantify
uncertainty after sample generation, failing to actively collect uncertain
samples that could enhance state coverage and improve model accuracy. Moreover,
MBRL often faces difficulties in making accurate multi-step predictions,
thereby impacting overall performance. To address these limitations, we propose
a novel framework for uncertainty-aware policy optimization with model-based
exploratory planning. In the model-based planning phase, we introduce an
uncertainty-aware k-step lookahead planning approach to guide action selection
at each step. This process involves a trade-off analysis between model
uncertainty and value function approximation error, effectively enhancing
policy performance. In the policy optimization phase, we leverage an
uncertainty-driven exploratory policy to actively collect diverse training
samples, resulting in improved model accuracy and overall performance of the RL
agent. Our approach offers flexibility and applicability to tasks with varying
state/action spaces and reward structures. We validate its effectiveness
through experiments on challenging robotic manipulation tasks and Atari games,
surpassing state-of-the-art methods with fewer interactions, thereby leading to
significant performance improvements.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-26 00:10:01</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in complex environments, such as video games. However, they still
fall short of achieving human-like sample efficiency and adaptability when
learning new domains. Theory-based reinforcement learning (TBRL) is an
algorithmic framework specifically designed to address this gap. Modeled on
cognitive theories, TBRL leverages structured, causal world models - "theories"
- as forward simulators for use in planning, generalization and exploration.
Although current TBRL systems provide compelling explanations of how humans
learn to play video games, they face several technical limitations: their
theory languages are restrictive, and their planning algorithms are not
scalable. To address these challenges, we introduce TheoryCoder, an
instantiation of TBRL that exploits hierarchical representations of theories
and efficient program synthesis methods for more powerful learning and
planning. TheoryCoder equips agents with general-purpose abstractions (e.g.,
"move to"), which are then grounded in a particular environment by learning a
low-level transition model (a Python program synthesized from observations by a
large language model). A bilevel planning algorithm can exploit this
hierarchical structure to solve large domains. We demonstrate that this
approach can be successfully applied to diverse and challenging grid-world
games, where approaches based on directly synthesizing a policy perform poorly.
Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of using hierarchical abstractions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Automatic parameter tuning methods for planning algorithms, which integrate
pipeline approaches with learning-based techniques, are regarded as promising

reinforcement learning-based parameter tuning. The architecture introduces a
hierarchical structure with low-frequency parameter tuning, mid-frequency

upper-layer parameter tuning and lower-layer control through iterative

<p class='card-text'>Human-Object Interaction (HOI) is vital for advancing simulation, animation,
and robotics, enabling the generation of long-term, physically plausible
motions in 3D environments. However, existing methods often fall short of
achieving physics realism and supporting diverse types of interactions. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces a unified Human-Object
Interaction framework that provides unified control over interactions with
static scenes and dynamic objects using language commands. The interactions
between human and object parts can always be described as the continuous stable
Relative Movement Dynamics (RMD) between human and object parts. By leveraging
the world knowledge and scene perception capabilities of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), we translate language commands into RMD diagrams, which are used to
guide goal-conditioned reinforcement learning for sequential interaction with
objects. Our framework supports long-horizon interactions among dynamic,
articulated, and static objects. To support the training and evaluation of our
framework, we present a new dataset named Interplay, which includes multi-round
task plans generated by VLMs, covering both static and dynamic HOI tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively
handle a wide range of HOI tasks, showcasing its ability to maintain long-term,
multi-round transitions. For more details, please refer to our project webpage:

<p class='card-text'>This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based planning scheme

The framework employs a hierarchical decision-making structure with conditional
action masking, where high-level actions direct the robot's exploration, while
low-level actions optimize its navigation and efficient chemical spraying in
affected areas. The key objectives of optimization include improving the
coverage of infected areas with limited battery power and reducing chemical

numerical experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method,
Hierarchical Action Masking Proximal Policy Optimization (HAM-PPO),
significantly outperforms baseline practices, such as LawnMower navigation +
indiscriminate spraying (Carpet Spray), in terms of yield recovery and resource

sampling efficiency and high interaction cost. In contrast to MFRL, Model-Based
RL (MBRL) offers an alternative solution to boost sample efficiency and
stabilize the training by explicitly leveraging a learned environment model.
However, establishing an accurate dynamic model for complex and noisy
environments necessitates a careful balance between model accuracy and
computational complexity $\&$ stability. To address these issues, we propose a
Conditional Diffusion Model Planner (CDMP) for high-dimensional offline
resource allocation in clustered ad hoc networks. By leveraging the astonishing
generative capability of Diffusion Models (DMs), our approach enables the
accurate modeling of high-quality environmental dynamics while leveraging an
inverse dynamics model to plan a superior policy. Beyond simply adopting DMs in
offline RL, we further incorporate the CDMP algorithm with a theoretically
guaranteed, uncertainty-aware penalty metric, which theoretically and
empirically manifests itself in mitigating the Out-of-Distribution
(OOD)-induced distribution shift issue underlying scarce training data.
Extensive experiments also show that our model outperforms MFRL in average
reward and Quality of Service (QoS) while demonstrating comparable performance
to other MBRL algorithms.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Radiotherapy treatment planning is a complex and time-intensive process,
often impacted by inter-planner variability and subjective decision-making. To
address these challenges, we introduce Dose Optimization Language Agent (DOLA),
an autonomous large language model (LLM)-based agent designed for optimizing
radiotherapy treatment plans while rigorously protecting patient privacy. DOLA
integrates the LLaMa3.1 LLM directly with a commercial treatment planning
system, utilizing chain-of-thought prompting, retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG), and reinforcement learning (RL). Operating entirely within secure local
infrastructure, this agent eliminates external data sharing. We evaluated DOLA
using a retrospective cohort of 18 prostate cancer patients prescribed 60 Gy in
20 fractions, comparing model sizes (8 billion vs. 70 billion parameters) and
optimization strategies (No-RAG, RAG, and RAG+RL) over 10 planning iterations.
The 70B model demonstrated significantly improved performance, achieving
approximately 16.4% higher final scores than the 8B model. The RAG approach
outperformed the No-RAG baseline by 19.8%, and incorporating RL accelerated
convergence, highlighting the synergy of retrieval-based memory and
reinforcement learning. Optimal temperature hyperparameter analysis identified
0.4 as providing the best balance between exploration and exploitation. This
proof of concept study represents the first successful deployment of locally
hosted LLM agents for autonomous optimization of treatment plans within a
commercial radiotherapy planning system. By extending human-machine interaction
through interpretable natural language reasoning, DOLA offers a scalable and
privacy-conscious framework, with significant potential for clinical
implementation and workflow improvement.</p>

  Container Management Problem</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>In this work, we augment reinforcement learning with an inference-time
collision model to ensure safe and efficient container management in a
waste-sorting facility with limited processing capacity. Each container has two
optimal emptying volumes that trade off higher throughput against overflow
risk. Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches struggle under
delayed rewards, sparse critical events, and high-dimensional uncertainty --
failing to consistently balance higher-volume empties with the risk of
safety-limit violations. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid
method comprising: (1) a curriculum-learning pipeline that incrementally trains
a PPO agent to handle delayed rewards and class imbalance, and (2) an offline
pairwise collision model used at inference time to proactively avert collisions
with minimal online cost. Experimental results show that our targeted
inference-time collision checks significantly improve collision avoidance,
reduce safety-limit violations, maintain high throughput, and scale effectively
across varying container-to-PU ratios. These findings offer actionable
guidelines for designing safe and efficient container-management systems in
real-world facilities.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become a promising solution for
structural health monitoring (SHM), especially in hard-to-reach or remote
locations. Battery-powered WSNs offer various advantages over wired systems,
however limited battery life has always been one of the biggest obstacles in
practical use of the WSNs, regardless of energy harvesting methods. While
various methods have been studied for battery health management, existing
methods exclusively aim to extend lifetime of individual batteries, lacking a
system level view. A consequence of applying such methods is that batteries in
a WSN tend to fail at different times, posing significant difficulty on
planning and scheduling of battery replacement trip. This study investigate a
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for active battery degradation
management by optimizing duty cycle of WSNs at the system level. This active
management strategy effectively reduces earlier failure of battery individuals
which enable group replacement without sacrificing WSN performances. A
simulated environment based on a real-world WSN setup was developed to train a
DRL agent and learn optimal duty cycle strategies. The performance of the
strategy was validated in a long-term setup with various network sizes,
demonstrating its efficiency and scalability.</p>
