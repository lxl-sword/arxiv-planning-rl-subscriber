<p class='card-text'>Unsupervised zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for pretraining behavioral foundation models (BFMs), enabling agents
to solve a wide range of downstream tasks specified via reward functions in a
zero-shot fashion, i.e., without additional test-time learning or planning.
This is achieved by learning self-supervised task embeddings alongside
corresponding near-optimal behaviors and incorporating an inference procedure
to directly retrieve the latent task embedding and associated policy for any
given reward function. Despite promising results, zero-shot policies are often
suboptimal due to errors induced by the unsupervised training process, the
embedding, and the inference procedure. In this paper, we focus on devising
fast adaptation strategies to improve the zero-shot performance of BFMs in a
few steps of online interaction with the environment while avoiding any
performance drop during the adaptation process. Notably, we demonstrate that
existing BFMs learn a set of skills containing more performant policies than
those identified by their inference procedure, making them well-suited for fast
adaptation. Motivated by this observation, we propose both actor-critic and
actor-only fast adaptation strategies that search in the low-dimensional
task-embedding space of the pre-trained BFM to rapidly improve the performance
of its zero-shot policies on any downstream task. Notably, our approach
mitigates the initial "unlearning" phase commonly observed when fine-tuning
pre-trained RL models. We evaluate our fast adaptation strategies on top of
four state-of-the-art zero-shot RL methods in multiple navigation and
locomotion domains. Our results show that they achieve 10-40% improvement over
their zero-shot performance in a few tens of episodes, outperforming existing
baselines.</p>

  Chain Planning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Vahid Eghbal Akhlaghi, Reza Zandehshahvar, Pascal Van Hentenryck</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-10 02:04:29</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper considers how to fuse Machine Learning (ML) and optimization to
solve large-scale Supply Chain Planning (SCP) optimization problems. These
problems can be formulated as MIP models which feature both integer
(non-binary) and continuous variables, as well as flow balance and capacity
constraints. This raises fundamental challenges for existing integrations of ML
and optimization that have focused on binary MIPs and graph problems. To
address these, the paper proposes PROPEL, a new framework that combines
optimization with both supervised and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to
reduce the size of search space significantly. PROPEL uses supervised learning,
not to predict the values of all integer variables, but to identify the
variables that are fixed to zero in the optimal solution, leveraging the
structure of SCP applications. PROPEL includes a DRL component that selects
which fixed-at-zero variables must be relaxed to improve solution quality when
the supervised learning step does not produce a solution with the desired
optimality tolerance. PROPEL has been applied to industrial supply chain
planning optimizations with millions of variables. The computational results
show dramatic improvements in solution times and quality, including a 60%
reduction in primal integral and an 88% primal gap reduction, and improvement
factors of up to 13.57 and 15.92, respectively.</p>

  Navigation in Cluttered Environments</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Licheng Luo, Mingyu Cai</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-09 21:19:51</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful model-free
paradigm for learning optimal policies. However, in real-world navigation
tasks, DRL methods often suffer from insufficient exploration, particularly in
cluttered environments with sparse rewards or complex dynamics under system
disturbances. To address this challenge, we bridge general graph-based motion
planning with DRL, enabling agents to explore cluttered spaces more effectively
and achieve desired navigation performance. Specifically, we design a dense
reward function grounded in a graph structure that spans the entire state
space. This graph provides rich guidance, steering the agent toward optimal
strategies. We validate our approach in challenging environments, demonstrating
substantial improvements in exploration efficiency and task success rates. The

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Elisabeth Dillies, Quentin Delfosse, Jannis Blüml, Raban Emunds, Florian Peter Busch, Kristian Kersting</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-09 20:29:13</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) agents have shown remarkable performances in
various environments, where they can discover effective policies directly from
sensory inputs. However, these agents often exploit spurious correlations in
the training data, resulting in brittle behaviours that fail to generalize to
new or slightly modified environments. To address this, we introduce the Causal
Object-centric Model Extraction Tool (COMET), a novel algorithm designed to
learn the exact interpretable causal world models (CWMs). COMET first extracts
object-centric state descriptions from observations and identifies the
environment's internal states related to the depicted objects' properties.
Using symbolic regression, it models object-centric transitions and derives
causal relationships governing object dynamics. COMET further incorporates
large language models (LLMs) for semantic inference, annotating causal
variables to enhance interpretability.
  By leveraging these capabilities, COMET constructs CWMs that align with the
true causal structure of the environment, enabling agents to focus on
task-relevant features. The extracted CWMs mitigate the danger of shortcuts,
permitting the development of RL systems capable of better planning and
decision-making across dynamic scenarios. Our results, validated in Atari
environments such as Pong and Freeway, demonstrate the accuracy and robustness
of COMET, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between object-centric
reasoning and causal inference in reinforcement learning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>An embodied system must not only model the patterns of the external world but
also understand its own motion dynamics. A motion dynamic model is essential
for efficient skill acquisition and effective planning. In this work, we
introduce the neural motion simulator (MoSim), a world model that predicts the
future physical state of an embodied system based on current observations and
actions. MoSim achieves state-of-the-art performance in physical state
prediction and provides competitive performance across a range of downstream
tasks. This works shows that when a world model is accurate enough and performs
precise long-horizon predictions, it can facilitate efficient skill acquisition
in imagined worlds and even enable zero-shot reinforcement learning.
Furthermore, MoSim can transform any model-free reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithm into a model-based approach, effectively decoupling physical
environment modeling from RL algorithm development. This separation allows for
independent advancements in RL algorithms and world modeling, significantly
improving sample efficiency and enhancing generalization capabilities. Our
findings highlight that world models for motion dynamics is a promising
direction for developing more versatile and capable embodied systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Assistance games are a promising alternative to reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) for training AI assistants. Assistance games resolve key
drawbacks of RLHF, such as incentives for deceptive behavior, by explicitly
modeling the interaction between assistant and user as a two-player game where
the assistant cannot observe their shared goal. Despite their potential,
assistance games have only been explored in simple settings. Scaling them to
more complex environments is difficult because it requires both solving
intractable decision-making problems under uncertainty and accurately modeling
human users' behavior. We present the first scalable approach to solving
assistance games and apply it to a new, challenging Minecraft-based assistance
game with over $10^{400}$ possible goals. Our approach, AssistanceZero, extends
AlphaZero with a neural network that predicts human actions and rewards,
enabling it to plan under uncertainty. We show that AssistanceZero outperforms
model-free RL algorithms and imitation learning in the Minecraft-based
assistance game. In a human study, our AssistanceZero-trained assistant
significantly reduces the number of actions participants take to complete
building tasks in Minecraft. Our results suggest that assistance games are a
tractable framework for training effective AI assistants in complex
environments. Our code and models are available at

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-09 07:53:09</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Loco-manipulation -- coordinated locomotion and physical interaction with
objects -- remains a major challenge for legged robots due to the need for both
accurate force interaction and robustness to unmodeled dynamics. While
model-based controllers provide interpretable dynamics-level planning and
optimization, they are limited by model inaccuracies and computational cost. In
contrast, learning-based methods offer robustness while struggling with precise
modulation of interaction forces. We introduce RAMBO -- RL-Augmented
Model-Based Optimal Control -- a hybrid framework that integrates model-based
reaction force optimization using a simplified dynamics model and a feedback
policy trained with reinforcement learning. The model-based module generates
feedforward torques by solving a quadratic program, while the policy provides
feedback residuals to enhance robustness in control execution. We validate our
framework on a quadruped robot across a diverse set of real-world
loco-manipulation tasks -- such as pushing a shopping cart, balancing a plate,
and holding soft objects -- in both quadrupedal and bipedal walking. Our
experiments demonstrate that RAMBO enables precise manipulation while achieving
robust and dynamic locomotion, surpassing the performance of policies trained
with end-to-end scheme. In addition, our method enables flexible trade-off
between end-effector tracking accuracy with compliance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) are an extension of the Traveling Salesperson
Problem and are a fundamental NP-hard challenge in combinatorial optimization.
Solving VRP in real-time at large scale has become critical in numerous
applications, from growing markets like last-mile delivery to emerging
use-cases like interactive logistics planning. Such applications involve
solving similar problem instances repeatedly, yet current state-of-the-art
solvers treat each instance on its own without leveraging previous examples. We
introduce a novel optimization framework that uses a reinforcement learning
agent - trained on prior instances - to quickly generate initial solutions,
which are then further optimized by genetic algorithms. Our framework,
Evolutionary Algorithm with Reinforcement Learning Initialization (EARLI),
consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art solvers across various time
scales. For example, EARLI handles vehicle routing with 500 locations within
1s, 10x faster than current solvers for the same solution quality, enabling
applications like real-time and interactive routing. EARLI can generalize to
new data, as demonstrated on real e-commerce delivery data of a previously
unseen city. Our hybrid framework presents a new way to combine reinforcement
learning and genetic algorithms, paving the road for closer interdisciplinary
collaboration between AI and optimization communities towards real-time
optimization in diverse domains.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) has driven many recent breakthroughs in deep
reinforcement learning (RL). However, scaling MCTS to parallel compute has
proven challenging in practice which has motivated alternative planners like
sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC). Many of these SMC methods adopt particle filters
for smoothing through a reformulation of RL as a policy inference problem. Yet,
persisting design choices of these particle filters often conflict with the aim
of online planning in RL, which is to obtain a policy improvement at the start
of planning. Drawing inspiration from MCTS, we tailor SMC planners specifically
for RL by improving data generation within the planner through constrained
action sampling and explicit terminal state handling, as well as improving
policy and value target estimation. This leads to our Trust-Region Twisted SMC
(TRT-SMC), which shows improved runtime and sample-efficiency over baseline
MCTS and SMC methods in both discrete and continuous domains.</p>

  Operational On-Demand Fulfillment via Reinforcement Learning with Information
  Shaping</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Xinwei Chen, Marlin W. Ulmer, Barrett W. Thomas</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-08 03:25:37</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The last few years have witnessed rapid growth in the on-demand delivery
market, with many start-ups entering the field. However, not all of these
start-ups have succeeded due to various reasons, among others, not being able
to establish a large enough customer base. In this paper, we address this
problem that many on-demand transportation start-ups face: how to establish
themselves in a new market. When starting, such companies often have limited
fleet resources to serve demand across a city. Depending on the use of the
fleet, varying service quality is observed in different areas of the city, and
in turn, the service quality impacts the respective growth of demand in each
area. Thus, operational fulfillment decisions drive the longer-term demand
development. To integrate strategic demand development into real-time
fulfillment operations, we propose a two-step approach. First, we derive
analytical insights into optimal allocation decisions for a stylized problem.
Second, we use these insights to shape the training data of a reinforcement
learning strategy for operational real-time fulfillment. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining operational efficiency with long-term strategic
planning is highly advantageous. Further, we show that the careful shaping of
training data is essential for the successful development of demand.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-07 02:52:39</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Traffic congestion remains a significant challenge in modern urban networks.
Autonomous driving technologies have emerged as a potential solution. Among
traffic control methods, reinforcement learning has shown superior performance
over traffic signals in various scenarios. However, prior research has largely
focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections, leaving large-scale
mixed traffic control largely unexplored. This study presents the first attempt
to use decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning for large-scale mixed
traffic control in which some intersections are managed by traffic signals and
others by robot vehicles. Evaluating a real-world network in Colorado Springs,
CO, USA with 14 intersections, we measure traffic efficiency via average
waiting time of vehicles at intersections and the number of vehicles reaching
their destinations within a time window (i.e., throughput). At 80% RV
penetration rate, our method reduces waiting time from 6.17 s to 5.09 s and
increases throughput from 454 vehicles per 500 seconds to 493 vehicles per 500
seconds, outperforming the baseline of fully signalized intersections. These
findings suggest that integrating reinforcement learning-based control
large-scale traffic can improve overall efficiency and may inform future urban

<p class='card-text'>We study the problem of learning control policies for complex tasks whose
requirements are given by a hyperproperty. The use of hyperproperties is
motivated by their significant power to formally specify requirements of
multi-agent systems as well as those that need expressiveness in terms of
multiple execution traces (e.g., privacy and fairness). Given a Markov decision
process M with unknown transitions (representing the environment) and a
HyperLTL formula $\varphi$, our approach first employs Skolemization to handle
quantifier alternations in $\varphi$. We introduce quantitative robustness
functions for HyperLTL to define rewards of finite traces of M with respect to
$\varphi$. Finally, we utilize a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm to
learn (1) a policy per trace quantifier in $\varphi$, and (2) the probability
distribution of transitions of M that together maximize the expected reward

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-06 09:07:10</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Online 3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP) has widespread applications in
industrial automation. Existing methods usually solve the problem with limited
resolution of spatial discretization, and/or cannot deal with complex practical
constraints well. We propose to enhance the practical applicability of online
3D-BPP via learning on a novel hierarchical representation, packing
configuration tree (PCT). PCT is a full-fledged description of the state and
action space of bin packing which can support packing policy learning based on
deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The size of the packing action space is
proportional to the number of leaf nodes, making the DRL model easy to train
and well-performing even with continuous solution space. We further discover
the potential of PCT as tree-based planners in deliberately solving packing
problems of industrial significance, including large-scale packing and
different variations of BPP setting. A recursive packing method is proposed to
decompose large-scale packing into smaller sub-trees while a spatial ensemble
mechanism integrates local solutions into global. For different BPP variations
with additional decision variables, such as lookahead, buffering, and offline
packing, we propose a unified planning framework enabling out-of-the-box
problem solving. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing online BPP baselines and is versatile in incorporating various
practical constraints. The planning process excels across large-scale problems
and diverse problem variations. We develop a real-world packing robot for
industrial warehousing, with careful designs accounting for constrained
placement and transportation stability. Our packing robot operates reliably and
efficiently on unprotected pallets at 10 seconds per box. It achieves averagely

interactions. Unlike RAG-based approaches that assume all necessary information
exists within a fixed corpus, our method trains agents to navigate the noisy,
unstructured, and dynamic nature of the open web. We implement a specialized
multi-agent architecture where browsing agents extract relevant information
from various webpage structures and overcoming significant technical
challenges. Extensive experiments on open-domain research tasks demonstrate
that DeepResearcher achieves substantial improvements of up to 28.9 points over
prompt engineering-based baselines and up to 7.2 points over RAG-based RL
agents. Our qualitative analysis reveals emergent cognitive behaviors from
end-to-end RL training, including the ability to formulate plans,
cross-validate information from multiple sources, engage in self-reflection to
redirect research, and maintain honesty when unable to find definitive answers.
Our results highlight that end-to-end training in real-world web environments
is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental requirement for
developing robust research capabilities aligned with real-world applications.

<p class='card-text'>Path planning and optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted
next-generation wireless networks is critical for mobility management and
ensuring UAV safety and ubiquitous connectivity, especially in dense urban
environments with street canyons and tall buildings. Traditional statistical
and model-based techniques have been successfully used for path optimization in
communication networks. However, when dynamic channel propagation
characteristics such as line-of-sight (LOS), interference, handover, and
signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) are included in path
optimization, statistical and model-based path planning solutions become
obsolete since they cannot adapt to the dynamic and time-varying wireless
channels, especially in the mmWave bands. In this paper, we propose a novel
model-free actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (AC-DRL) framework for path
optimization in UAV-assisted 5G mmWave wireless networks, which combines four
important aspects of UAV communication: \textit{flight time, handover,
connectivity and SINR}. We train an AC-RL agent that enables a UAV connected to
a gNB to determine the optimal path to a desired destination in the shortest
possible time with minimal gNB handover, while maintaining connectivity and the
highest possible SINR. We train our model with data from a powerful ray tracing
tool called Wireless InSite, which uses 3D images of the propagation
environment and provides data that closely resembles the real propagation
environment. The simulation results show that our system has superior
performance in tracking high SINR compared to other selected RL algorithms.</p>

  in Nuclear Decommissioning</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Active 3D scene representation is pivotal in modern robotics applications,
including remote inspection, manipulation, and telepresence. Traditional
methods primarily optimize geometric fidelity or rendering accuracy, but often
overlook operator-specific objectives, such as safety-critical coverage or
task-driven viewpoints. This limitation leads to suboptimal viewpoint
selection, particularly in constrained environments such as nuclear
decommissioning. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates expert operator preferences into the active 3D scene representation
pipeline. Specifically, we employ Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) to guide robotic path planning, reshaping the reward function based on
expert input. To capture operator-specific priorities, we conduct interactive
choice experiments that evaluate user preferences in 3D scene representation.
We validate our framework using a UR3e robotic arm for reactor tile inspection
in a nuclear decommissioning scenario. Compared to baseline methods, our
approach enhances scene representation while optimizing trajectory efficiency.
The RLHF-based policy consistently outperforms random selection, prioritizing
task-critical details. By unifying explicit 3D geometric modeling with implicit
human-in-the-loop optimization, this work establishes a foundation for
adaptive, safety-critical robotic perception systems, paving the way for
enhanced automation in nuclear decommissioning, remote maintenance, and other
high-risk environments.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Thomas Bush, Stephen Chung, Usman Anwar, Adrià Garriga-Alonso, David Krueger</h6>

<p class='card-text'>We present the first mechanistic evidence that model-free reinforcement
learning agents can learn to plan. This is achieved by applying a methodology
based on concept-based interpretability to a model-free agent in Sokoban -- a
commonly used benchmark for studying planning. Specifically, we demonstrate
that DRC, a generic model-free agent introduced by Guez et al. (2019), uses
learned concept representations to internally formulate plans that both predict
the long-term effects of actions on the environment and influence action
selection. Our methodology involves: (1) probing for planning-relevant
concepts, (2) investigating plan formation within the agent's representations,
and (3) verifying that discovered plans (in the agent's representations) have a
causal effect on the agent's behavior through interventions. We also show that
the emergence of these plans coincides with the emergence of a planning-like
property: the ability to benefit from additional test-time compute. Finally, we
perform a qualitative analysis of the planning algorithm learned by the agent
and discover a strong resemblance to parallelized bidirectional search. Our
findings advance understanding of the internal mechanisms underlying planning
behavior in agents, which is important given the recent trend of emergent
planning and reasoning capabilities in LLMs through RL</p>
