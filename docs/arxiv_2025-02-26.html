  long-horizon prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Current robots face challenges in manipulation tasks that require a long
sequence of prehensile and non-prehensile skills. This involves handling
contact-rich interactions and chaining multiple skills while considering their
long-term consequences. This paper presents a framework that leverages
imitation learning to distill a planning algorithm, capable of solving
long-horizon problems but requiring extensive computation time, into a policy
for efficient action inference. We introduce $\texttt{Skill-RRT}$, an extension
of the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) that incorporates skill
applicability checks and intermediate object pose sampling for efficient
long-horizon planning. To enable skill chaining, we propose
$\textit{connectors}$, goal-conditioned policies that transition between skills
while minimizing object disturbance. Using lazy planning, connectors are
selectively trained on relevant transitions, reducing the cost of training.
High-quality demonstrations are generated with $\texttt{Skill-RRT}$ and refined
by a noise-based replay mechanism to ensure robust policy performance. The
distilled policy, trained entirely in simulation, zero-shot transfer to the
real world, and achieves over 80% success rates across three challenging
manipulation tasks. In simulation, our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art skill-based reinforcement learning method, $\texttt{MAPLE}$,
and $\texttt{Skill-RRT}$.</p>

<h4 class='card-title'><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17813v1' target='_blank'>Safe Multi-Agent Navigation guided by Goal-Conditioned Safe
  Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Meng Feng, Viraj Parimi, Brian Williams</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-25 03:38:52</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Safe navigation is essential for autonomous systems operating in hazardous
environments. Traditional planning methods excel at long-horizon tasks but rely
on a predefined graph with fixed distance metrics. In contrast, safe
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors without relying on
manual heuristics but fails to solve long-horizon tasks, particularly in
goal-conditioned and multi-agent scenarios.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel method that integrates the strengths of
both planning and safe RL. Our method leverages goal-conditioned RL and safe RL
to learn a goal-conditioned policy for navigation while concurrently estimating
cumulative distance and safety levels using learned value functions via an
automated self-training algorithm. By constructing a graph with states from the
replay buffer, our method prunes unsafe edges and generates a waypoint-based
plan that the agent follows until reaching its goal, effectively balancing
faster and safer routes over extended distances.
  Utilizing this unified high-level graph and a shared low-level
goal-conditioned safe RL policy, we extend this approach to address the
multi-agent safe navigation problem. In particular, we leverage Conflict-Based
Search (CBS) to create waypoint-based plans for multiple agents allowing for
their safe navigation over extended horizons. This integration enhances the
scalability of goal-conditioned safe RL in multi-agent scenarios, enabling
efficient coordination among agents.
  Extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method in achieving distance goals safely for multiple
agents in complex and hazardous environments. Our code will be released to
support future research.</p>

<h4 class='card-title'><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17758v1' target='_blank'>Applications of deep reinforcement learning to urban transit network
  design</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Andrew Holliday</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-25 01:24:20</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This thesis concerns the use of reinforcement learning to train neural
networks to aid in the design of public transit networks. The Transit Network
Design Problem (TNDP) is an optimization problem of considerable practical
importance. Given a city with an existing road network and travel demands, the
goal is to find a set of transit routes - each of which is a path through the
graph - that collectively satisfy all demands, while minimizing a cost function
that may depend both on passenger satisfaction and operating costs. The
existing literature on this problem mainly considers metaheuristic optimization
algorithms, such as genetic algorithms and ant-colony optimization. By
contrast, we begin by taking a reinforcement learning approach, formulating the
construction of a set of transit routes as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and
training a neural net policy to act as the agent in this MDP. We then show
that, beyond using this policy to plan a transit network directly, it can be
combined with existing metaheuristic algorithms, both to initialize the
solution and to suggest promising moves at each step of a search through
solution space. We find that such hybrid algorithms, which use a neural policy
trained via reinforcement learning as a core component within a classical
metaheuristic framework, can plan transit networks that are superior to those
planned by either the neural policy or the metaheuristic algorithm. We
demonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to redesign the transit
network for the city of Laval, Quebec, and show that in simulation, the
resulting transit network provides better service at lower cost than the
existing transit network.</p>

  Robot Learning in Natural Human-Robot Interaction</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-23 21:27:06</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Recent advances in multimodal Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) datasets
emphasize the integration of speech and gestures, allowing robots to absorb
explicit knowledge and tacit understanding. However, existing datasets
primarily focus on elementary tasks like object pointing and pushing, limiting
their applicability to complex domains. They prioritize simpler human command
data but place less emphasis on training robots to correctly interpret tasks
and respond appropriately. To address these gaps, we present the NatSGLD
dataset, which was collected using a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) method, where
participants interacted with a robot they believed to be autonomous. NatSGLD
records humans' multimodal commands (speech and gestures), each paired with a
demonstration trajectory and a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula that
provides a ground-truth interpretation of the commanded tasks. This dataset
serves as a foundational resource for research at the intersection of HRI and
machine learning. By providing multimodal inputs and detailed annotations,
NatSGLD enables exploration in areas such as multimodal instruction following,
plan recognition, and human-advisable reinforcement learning from
demonstrations. We release the dataset and code under the MIT License at
https://www.snehesh.com/natsgld/ to support future HRI research.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Po-Wei Huang, Pei-Chiun Peng, Hung Guei, Ti-Rong Wu</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-23 16:20:15</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Planning with options -- a sequence of primitive actions -- has been shown
effective in reinforcement learning within complex environments. Previous
studies have focused on planning with predefined options or learned options
through expert demonstration data. Inspired by MuZero, which learns superhuman
heuristics without any human knowledge, we propose a novel approach, named
OptionZero. OptionZero incorporates an option network into MuZero, providing
autonomous discovery of options through self-play games. Furthermore, we modify
the dynamics network to provide environment transitions when using options,
allowing searching deeper under the same simulation constraints. Empirical
experiments conducted in 26 Atari games demonstrate that OptionZero outperforms
MuZero, achieving a 131.58% improvement in mean human-normalized score. Our
behavior analysis shows that OptionZero not only learns options but also
acquires strategic skills tailored to different game characteristics. Our
findings show promising directions for discovering and using options in
planning. Our code is available at

  Transfer-assisted IoT Systems</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-23 02:57:06</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)-assisted
Internet of Things (IoT) systems face the following challenges: limited
resources and suboptimal trajectory planning. Reinforcement learning-based
trajectory planning schemes face issues of low search efficiency and learning
instability when optimizing large-scale systems. To address these issues, we
present an Attention-based UAV Trajectory Optimization (AUTO) framework based
on the graph transformer, which consists of an Attention Trajectory
Optimization Model (ATOM) and a Trajectory lEarNing Method based on
Actor-critic (TENMA). In ATOM, a graph encoder is used to calculate the
self-attention characteristics of all IoTDs, and a trajectory decoder is
developed to optimize the number and trajectories of UAVs. TENMA then trains
the ATOM using an improved Actor-Critic method, in which the real reward of the
system is applied as the baseline to reduce variances in the critic network.
This method is suitable for high-quality and large-scale multi-UAV trajectory
planning. Finally, we develop numerous experiments, including a hardware
experiment in the field case, to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the
AUTO framework.</p>

  Models with Continual Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Masoud Shokrnezhad, Tarik Taleb</h6>

<p class='card-text'>6G networks aim to achieve global coverage, massive connectivity, and
ultra-stringent requirements. Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGINs) and
Semantic Communication (SemCom) are essential for realizing these goals, yet
they introduce considerable complexity in resource orchestration. Drawing
inspiration from research in robotics, a viable solution to manage this
complexity is the application of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although the use
of LLMs in network orchestration has recently gained attention, existing
solutions have not sufficiently addressed LLM hallucinations or their
adaptation to network dynamics. To address this gap, this paper proposes a
framework called Autonomous Reinforcement Coordination (ARC) for a
SemCom-enabled SAGIN. This framework employs an LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented
Generator (RAG) monitors services, users, and resources and processes the
collected data, while a Hierarchical Action Planner (HAP) orchestrates
resources. ARC decomposes orchestration into two tiers, utilizing LLMs for
high-level planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents for low-level
decision-making, in alignment with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) concept. The
LLMs utilize Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for few-shot learning, empowered
by contrastive learning, while the RL agents employ replay buffer management
for continual learning, thereby achieving efficiency, accuracy, and
adaptability. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of ARC,
along with a comprehensive discussion on potential future research directions
to enhance and upgrade ARC.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results in sequential
decision-making tasks. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged, exhibiting impressive capabilities
in multimodal understanding and reasoning. These advances have led to a surge
of research integrating LLMs and VLMs into RL. In this survey, we review
representative works in which LLMs and VLMs are used to overcome key challenges
in RL, such as lack of prior knowledge, long-horizon planning, and reward
design. We present a taxonomy that categorizes these LLM/VLM-assisted RL
approaches into three roles: agent, planner, and reward. We conclude by
exploring open problems, including grounding, bias mitigation, improved
representations, and action advice. By consolidating existing research and
identifying future directions, this survey establishes a framework for

<p class='card-text'>Over the last decade, the use of machine learning (ML) approaches in
medicinal applications has increased manifold. Most of these approaches are
based on deep learning, which aims to learn representations from grid data
(like medical images). However, reinforcement learning (RL) applications in
medicine are relatively less explored. Medical applications often involve a
sequence of subtasks that form a diagnostic pipeline, and RL is uniquely suited
to optimize over such sequential decision-making tasks. Ultrasound (US) image
analysis is a quintessential example of such a sequential decision-making task,
where the raw signal captured by the US transducer undergoes a series of signal
processing and image post-processing steps, generally leading to a diagnostic
suggestion. The application of RL in US remains limited. Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL), that combines deep learning and RL, holds great promise in
optimizing these pipelines by enabling intelligent and sequential
decision-making. This review paper surveys the applications of RL in US over
the last decade. We provide a succinct overview of the theoretic framework of
RL and its application in US image processing and review existing work in each
aspect of the image analysis pipeline. A comprehensive search of Scopus
filtered on relevance yielded 14 papers most relevant to this topic. These
papers were further categorized based on their target applications image
classification, image segmentation, image enhancement, video summarization, and
auto navigation and path planning. We also examined the type of RL approach
used in each publication. Finally, we discuss key areas in healthcare where DRL
approaches in US could be used for sequential decision-making. We analyze the
opportunities, challenges, and limitations, providing insights into the future
potential of DRL in US image analysis.</p>

<p class='card-text'>A long-standing goal in AI is to build agents that can solve a variety of
tasks across different environments, including previously unseen ones. Two
dominant approaches tackle this challenge: (i) reinforcement learning (RL),
which learns policies through trial and error, and (ii) optimal control, which
plans actions using a learned or known dynamics model. However, their relative
strengths and weaknesses remain underexplored in the setting where agents must
learn from offline trajectories without reward annotations. In this work, we
systematically analyze the performance of different RL and control-based
methods under datasets of varying quality. On the RL side, we consider
goal-conditioned and zero-shot approaches. On the control side, we train a
latent dynamics model using the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)
and use it for planning. We study how dataset properties-such as data
diversity, trajectory quality, and environment variability-affect the
performance of these approaches. Our results show that model-free RL excels
when abundant, high-quality data is available, while model-based planning
excels in generalization to novel environment layouts, trajectory stitching,
and data-efficiency. Notably, planning with a latent dynamics model emerges as
a promising approach for zero-shot generalization from suboptimal data.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-20 05:02:29</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Deep reinforcement learning agents often face challenges to effectively
coordinate perception and decision-making components, particularly in
environments with high-dimensional sensory inputs where feature relevance
varies. This work introduces SPRIG (Stackelberg Perception-Reinforcement
learning with Internal Game dynamics), a framework that models the internal
perception-policy interaction within a single agent as a cooperative
Stackelberg game. In SPRIG, the perception module acts as a leader,
strategically processing raw sensory states, while the policy module follows,
making decisions based on extracted features. SPRIG provides theoretical
guarantees through a modified Bellman operator while preserving the benefits of
modern policy optimization. Experimental results on the Atari BeamRider
environment demonstrate SPRIG's effectiveness, achieving around 30% higher
returns than standard PPO through its game-theoretical balance of feature
extraction and decision-making.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Decarbonization plans promote the transition to heat pumps (HPs), creating
new opportunities for their energy flexibility in demand response programs,
solar photovoltaic integration and optimization of distribution networks. This
paper reviews scheduling-based and real-time optimization methods for
controlling HPs with a focus on energy flexibility in distribution networks.
Scheduling-based methods fall into two categories: rule-based controllers
(RBCs), which rely on predefined control rules without explicitly seeking
optimal solutions, and optimization models, which are designed to determine the
optimal scheduling of operations. Real-time optimization is achieved through
model predictive control (MPC), which relies on a predictive model to optimize
decisions over a time horizon, and reinforcement learning (RL), which takes a
model-free approach by learning optimal strategies through direct interaction
with the environment. The paper also examines studies on the impact of HPs on
distribution networks, particularly those leveraging energy flexibility
strategies. Key takeaways suggest the need to validate control strategies for
extreme cold-weather regions that require backup heaters, as well as develop
approaches designed for demand charge schemes that integrate HPs with other
controllable loads. From a grid impact assessment perspective, studies have
focused primarily on RBCs for providing energy flexibility through HP
operation, without addressing more advanced methods such as real-time
optimization using MPC or RL-based algorithms. Incorporating these advanced
control strategies could help identify key limitations, including the impact of
varying user participation levels and the cost-benefit trade-offs associated
with their implementation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>It is popular lately to train large language models to be used as chat
assistants, but in the conversation between the user and the chat assistant,
there are prompts, require multi-turns between the chat assistant and the user.
However, there are a number of issues with the multi-turns conversation: The
response of the chat assistant is prone to errors and can't help users achieve
their goals, and as the number of conversation turns increases, the probability
of errors will also increase; It is difficult for chat assistant to generate
responses with different processes based on actual needs for the same prompt;
Chat assistant require the use of tools, but the current approach is not
elegant and efficient, and the number of tool calls is limited. The main reason
for these issues is that large language models don't have the thinking ability
as a human, lack the reasoning ability and planning ability, and lack the
ability to execute plans. To solve these issues, we propose a thinking method
based on a built-in chain of thought: In the multi-turns conversation, for each
user prompt, the large language model thinks based on elements such as chat
history, thinking context, action calls, memory and knowledge, makes detailed
reasoning and planning, and actions according to the plan. We also explored how
the large language model enhances thinking ability through this thinking
method: Collect training datasets according to the thinking method and fine
tune the large language model through supervised learning; Train a consistency
reward model and use it as a reward function to fine tune the large language
model using reinforcement learning, and the reinforced large language model
outputs according to this way of thinking. Our experimental results show that
the reasoning ability and planning ability of the large language model are
enhanced, and the issues in the multi-turns conversation are solved.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The efficient planning of stacking boxes, especially in the online setting
where the sequence of item arrivals is unpredictable, remains a critical
challenge in modern warehouse and logistics management. Existing solutions
often address box size variations, but overlook their intrinsic and physical
properties, such as density and rigidity, which are crucial for real-world
applications. We use reinforcement learning (RL) to solve this problem by
employing action space masking to direct the RL policy toward valid actions.
Unlike previous methods that rely on heuristic stability assessments which are
difficult to assess in physical scenarios, our framework utilizes online
learning to dynamically train the action space mask, eliminating the need for
manual heuristic design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, we deploy our

<p class='card-text'>Recently, there has been growing interest in leveraging large language models
(LLMs) to generate symbolic world models from textual descriptions. Although
LLMs have been extensively explored in the context of world modeling, prior
studies encountered several challenges, including evaluation randomness,
dependence on indirect metrics, and a limited domain scope. To address these
limitations, we introduce a novel benchmark, Text2World, based on planning
domain definition language (PDDL), featuring hundreds of diverse domains and
employing multi-criteria, execution-based metrics for a more robust evaluation.
We benchmark current LLMs using Text2World and find that reasoning models
trained with large-scale reinforcement learning outperform others. However,
even the best-performing model still demonstrates limited capabilities in world
modeling. Building on these insights, we examine several promising strategies
to enhance the world modeling capabilities of LLMs, including test-time

<p class='card-text'>Automated Planning algorithms require a model of the domain that specifies
the preconditions and effects of each action. Obtaining such a domain model is
notoriously hard. Algorithms for learning domain models exist, yet it remains
unclear whether learning a domain model and planning is an effective approach
for numeric planning environments, i.e., where states include discrete and
numeric state variables. In this work, we explore the benefits of learning a
numeric domain model and compare it with alternative model-free solutions. As a
case study, we use two tasks in Minecraft, a popular sandbox game that has been
used as an AI challenge. First, we consider an offline learning setting, where
a set of expert trajectories are available to learn from. This is the standard
setting for learning domain models. We used the Numeric Safe Action Model
Learning (NSAM) algorithm to learn a numeric domain model and solve new
problems with the learned domain model and a numeric planner. We call this
model-based solution NSAM_(+p), and compare it to several model-free Imitation
Learning (IL) and Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Empirical
results show that some IL algorithms can learn faster to solve simple tasks,
while NSAM_(+p) allows solving tasks that require long-term planning and
enables generalizing to solve problems in larger environments. Then, we
consider an online learning setting, where learning is done by moving an agent
in the environment. For this setting, we introduce RAMP. In RAMP, observations
collected during the agent's execution are used to simultaneously train an RL
policy and learn a planning domain action model. This forms a positive feedback
loop between the RL policy and the learned domain model. We demonstrate
experimentally the benefits of using RAMP, showing that it finds more efficient
plans and solves more problems than several RL baselines.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In-band network telemetry (INT) is essential to network management due to its
real-time visibility. However, because of the rapid increase in network devices
and services, it has become crucial to have targeted access to detailed network
information in a dynamic network environment. This paper proposes an
intelligent network telemetry system called NTP-INT to obtain more fine-grained
network information on high-load switches. Specifically, NTP-INT consists of
three modules: network traffic prediction module, network pruning module, and
probe path planning module. Firstly, the network traffic prediction module
adopts a Multi-Temporal Graph Neural Network (MTGNN) to predict future network
traffic and identify high-load switches. Then, we design the network pruning
algorithm to generate a subnetwork covering all high-load switches to reduce
the complexity of probe path planning. Finally, the probe path planning module
uses an attention-mechanism-based deep reinforcement learning (DEL) model to
plan efficient probe paths in the network slice. The experimental results
demonstrate that NTP-INT can acquire more precise network information on
high-load switches while decreasing the control overhead by 50\%.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in solving various
combinatorial optimization problems. However, conventional RL faces challenges
when dealing with real-world constraints, especially when action space
feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory.
In this work, we focus on using RL in container shipping, often considered the
cornerstone of global trade, by dealing with the critical challenge of master
stowage planning. The main objective is to maximize cargo revenue and minimize
operational costs while navigating demand uncertainty and various complex
operational constraints, namely vessel capacity and stability, which must be
dynamically updated along the vessel's voyage. To address this problem, we
implement a deep reinforcement learning framework with feasibility projection
to solve the master stowage planning problem (MPP) under demand uncertainty.
The experimental results show that our architecture efficiently finds adaptive,
feasible solutions for this multi-stage stochastic optimization problem,
outperforming traditional mixed-integer programming and RL with feasibility
regularization. Our AI-driven decision-support policy enables adaptive and
feasible planning under uncertainty, optimizing operational efficiency and
capacity utilization while contributing to sustainable and resilient global
supply chains.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Diffusion policies have shown promise in learning complex behaviors from
demonstrations, particularly for tasks requiring precise control and long-term
planning. However, they face challenges in robustness when encountering
distribution shifts. This paper explores improving diffusion-based imitation
learning models through online interactions with the environment. We propose
OTPR (Optimal Transport-guided score-based diffusion Policy for Reinforcement
learning fine-tuning), a novel method that integrates diffusion policies with
RL using optimal transport theory. OTPR leverages the Q-function as a transport
cost and views the policy as an optimal transport map, enabling efficient and
stable fine-tuning. Moreover, we introduce masked optimal transport to guide
state-action matching using expert keypoints and a compatibility-based
resampling strategy to enhance training stability. Experiments on three
simulation tasks demonstrate OTPR's superior performance and robustness
compared to existing methods, especially in complex and sparse-reward
environments. In sum, OTPR provides an effective framework for combining IL and
RL, achieving versatile and reliable policy learning. The code will be released
at https://github.com/Sunmmyy/OTPR.git.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Large language models (LLMs) have risen to prominence as 'chatbots' for users
to interact via natural language. However, their abilities to capture
common-sense knowledge make them seem promising as language-based planners of
situated or embodied action as well. We have implemented a simple text-based
environment -- similar to others that have before been used for
reinforcement-learning of agents -- that simulates, very abstractly, a
household setting. We use this environment and the detailed error-tracking
capabilities we implemented for targeted benchmarking of LLMs on the problem of
practical reasoning: Going from goals and observations to actions. Our findings
show that environmental complexity and game restrictions hamper performance,
and concise action planning is demanding for current LLMs.</p>
