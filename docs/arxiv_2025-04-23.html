<h4 class='card-title'><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15876v1' target='_blank'>Bidirectional Task-Motion Planning Based on Hierarchical Reinforcement
  Learning for Strategic Confrontation</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Qizhen Wu Lei Chen, Kexin Liu, Jinhu LÃ¼</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-22 13:22:58</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In swarm robotics, confrontation scenarios, including strategic
confrontations, require efficient decision-making that integrates discrete
commands and continuous actions. Traditional task and motion planning methods
separate decision-making into two layers, but their unidirectional structure
fails to capture the interdependence between these layers, limiting
adaptability in dynamic environments. Here, we propose a novel bidirectional
approach based on hierarchical reinforcement learning, enabling dynamic
interaction between the layers. This method effectively maps commands to task
allocation and actions to path planning, while leveraging cross-training
techniques to enhance learning across the hierarchical framework. Furthermore,
we introduce a trajectory prediction model that bridges abstract task
representations with actionable planning goals. In our experiments, it achieves
over 80\% in confrontation win rate and under 0.01 seconds in decision time,
outperforming existing approaches. Demonstrations through large-scale tests and
real-world robot experiments further emphasize the generalization capabilities
and practical applicability of our method.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Deploying robot learning methods to a quadrotor in unstructured outdoor
environments is an exciting task. Quadrotors operating in real-world
environments by learning-based methods encounter several challenges: a large
amount of simulator generated data required for training, strict demands for
real-time processing onboard, and the sim-to-real gap caused by dynamic and
noisy conditions. Current works have made a great breakthrough in applying
learning-based methods to end-to-end control of quadrotors, but rarely mention
the infrastructure system training from scratch and deploying to reality, which
makes it difficult to reproduce methods and applications. To bridge this gap,
we propose a platform that enables the seamless transfer of end-to-end deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We integrate the training environment,
flight dynamics control, DRL algorithms, the MAVROS middleware stack, and
hardware into a comprehensive workflow and architecture that enables
quadrotors' policies to be trained from scratch to real-world deployment in
several minutes. Our platform provides rich types of environments including
hovering, dynamic obstacle avoidance, trajectory tracking, balloon hitting, and
planning in unknown environments, as a physical experiment benchmark. Through
extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate the efficiency of proposed
sim-to-real platform, and robust outdoor flight performance under real-world
perturbations. Details can be found from our website

<p class='card-text'>This paper develops a novel unmanned surface vehicle (USV)-autonomous
underwater vehicle (AUV) collaborative system designed to enhance underwater

  Closed-Loop Simulator, Causal Benchmark and Joint IL-RL Baseline</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Hui Zhou, Shaoshuai Shi, Hongsheng Li</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-20 18:51:26</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Machine learning (ML)-based planners have recently gained significant
attention. They offer advantages over traditional optimization-based planning
algorithms. These advantages include fewer manually selected parameters and
faster development. Within ML-based planning, imitation learning (IL) is a
common algorithm. It primarily learns driving policies directly from supervised
trajectory data. While IL has demonstrated strong performance on many open-loop
benchmarks, it remains challenging to determine if the learned policy truly
understands fundamental driving principles, rather than simply extrapolating
from the ego-vehicle's initial state. Several studies have identified this
limitation and proposed algorithms to address it. However, these methods often
use original datasets for evaluation. In these datasets, future trajectories
are heavily dependent on initial conditions. Furthermore, IL often overfits to
the most common scenarios. It struggles to generalize to rare or unseen
situations.
  To address these challenges, this work proposes: 1) a novel closed-loop
simulator supporting both imitation and reinforcement learning, 2) a causal
benchmark derived from the Waymo Open Dataset to rigorously assess the impact
of the copycat problem, and 3) a novel framework integrating imitation learning
and reinforcement learning to overcome the limitations of purely imitative
approaches. The code for this work will be released soon.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Juan Nathaniel, Pierre Gentine</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-19 11:14:40</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Data-driven emulation of nonlinear dynamics is challenging due to long-range
skill decay that often produces physically unrealistic outputs. Recent advances
in generative modeling aim to address these issues by providing uncertainty
quantification and correction. However, the quality of generated simulation
remains heavily dependent on the choice of conditioning priors. In this work,
we present an efficient generative framework for dynamics emulation, unifying
principles of turbulence with diffusion-based modeling: Cohesion. Specifically,
our method estimates large-scale coherent structure of the underlying dynamics
as guidance during the denoising process, where small-scale fluctuation in the
flow is then resolved. These coherent priors are efficiently approximated using
reduced-order models, such as deep Koopman operators, that allow for rapid
generation of long prior sequences while maintaining stability over extended
forecasting horizon. With this gain, we can reframe forecasting as trajectory
planning, a common task in reinforcement learning, where conditional denoising
is performed once over entire sequences, minimizing the computational cost of
autoregressive-based generative methods. Empirical evaluations on chaotic
systems of increasing complexity, including Kolmogorov flow, shallow water
equations, and subseasonal-to-seasonal climate dynamics, demonstrate Cohesion
superior long-range forecasting skill that can efficiently generate
physically-consistent simulations, even in the presence of partially-observed
guidance.</p>

  Deliberative Reasoners</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Yuhang Liu, Pengxiang Li, Congkai Xie, Xavier Hu, Xiaotian Han, Shengyu Zhang, Hongxia Yang, Fei Wu</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-19 09:25:55</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have powered Graphical User
Interface (GUI) Agents, showing promise in automating tasks on computing
devices. Recent works have begun exploring reasoning in GUI tasks with
encouraging results. However, many current approaches rely on manually designed
reasoning templates, which may result in reasoning that is not sufficiently
robust and adaptive for complex GUI environments. Meanwhile, some existing
agents continue to operate as Reactive Actors, relying primarily on implicit
reasoning that may lack sufficient depth for GUI tasks demanding planning and
error recovery. We argue that advancing these agents requires a shift from
reactive acting towards acting based on deliberate reasoning. To facilitate
this transformation, we introduce InfiGUI-R1, an MLLM-based GUI agent developed
through our Actor2Reasoner framework, a reasoning-centric, two-stage training
approach designed to progressively evolve agents from Reactive Actors to
Deliberative Reasoners. The first stage, Reasoning Injection, focuses on
establishing a basic reasoner. We employ Spatial Reasoning Distillation to
transfer cross-modal spatial reasoning capabilities from teacher models to
MLLMs through trajectories with explicit reasoning steps, enabling models to
integrate GUI visual-spatial information with logical reasoning before action
generation. The second stage, Deliberation Enhancement, refines the basic
reasoner into a deliberative one using Reinforcement Learning. This stage
introduces two approaches: Sub-goal Guidance, which rewards models for
generating accurate intermediate sub-goals, and Error Recovery Scenario
Construction, which creates failure-and-recovery training scenarios from
identified prone-to-error steps. Experimental results show InfiGUI-R1 achieves
strong performance in GUI grounding and trajectory tasks. Resources at

  Graphs for LLM-Based Task Planning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Zheng Wang, Shu Xian Teo, Jun Jie Chew, Wei Shi</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-17 15:41:39</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their use as
agents for planning complex tasks. Existing methods typically rely on a
thought-action-observation (TAO) process to enhance LLM performance, but these
approaches are often constrained by the LLMs' limited knowledge of complex
tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers new opportunities by
leveraging external databases to ground generation in retrieved information. In
this paper, we identify two key challenges (enlargability and transferability)
in applying RAG to task planning. We propose InstructRAG, a novel solution
within a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning framework, to address these
challenges. InstructRAG includes a graph to organize past instruction paths
(sequences of correct actions), an RL-Agent with Reinforcement Learning to
expand graph coverage for enlargability, and an ML-Agent with Meta-Learning to
improve task generalization for transferability. The two agents are trained
end-to-end to optimize overall planning performance. Our experiments on four
widely used task planning datasets demonstrate that InstructRAG significantly
enhances performance and adapts efficiently to new tasks, achieving up to a
19.2% improvement over the best existing approach.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper proposes SafeGPT, a two-tiered framework that integrates
generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for
efficient and reliable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) last-mile deliveries. In
the proposed design, a Global GPT module assigns high-level tasks such as
sector allocation, while an On-Device GPT manages real-time local route
planning. An RL-based safety filter monitors each GPT decision and overrides
unsafe actions that could lead to battery depletion or duplicate visits,
effectively mitigating hallucinations. Furthermore, a dual replay buffer
mechanism helps both the GPT modules and the RL agent refine their strategies
over time. Simulation results demonstrate that SafeGPT achieves higher delivery
success rates compared to a GPT-only baseline, while substantially reducing
battery consumption and travel distance. These findings validate the efficacy
of combining GPT-based semantic reasoning with formal safety guarantees,
contributing a viable solution for robust and energy-efficient UAV logistics.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-13 05:31:37</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Recently, Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered recommender systems (RecSys)
have brought significant advances in personalized user experience and have
attracted considerable attention. Despite the impressive progress, the research
question regarding the safety vulnerability of LLM-empowered RecSys still
remains largely under-investigated. Given the security and privacy concerns, it
is more practical to focus on attacking the black-box RecSys, where attackers
can only observe the system's inputs and outputs. However, traditional attack
approaches employing reinforcement learning (RL) agents are not effective for
attacking LLM-empowered RecSys due to the limited capabilities in processing
complex textual inputs, planning, and reasoning. On the other hand, LLMs
provide unprecedented opportunities to serve as attack agents to attack RecSys
because of their impressive capability in simulating human-like decision-making
processes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel attack framework called
CheatAgent by harnessing the human-like capabilities of LLMs, where an
LLM-based agent is developed to attack LLM-Empowered RecSys. Specifically, our
method first identifies the insertion position for maximum impact with minimal
input modification. After that, the LLM agent is designed to generate
adversarial perturbations to insert at target positions. To further improve the
quality of generated perturbations, we utilize the prompt tuning technique to
improve attacking strategies via feedback from the victim RecSys iteratively.
Extensive experiments across three real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed attacking method.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Mission planning for a fleet of cooperative autonomous drones in applications
that involve serving distributed target points, such as disaster response,
environmental monitoring, and surveillance, is challenging, especially under
partial observability, limited communication range, and uncertain environments.
Traditional path-planning algorithms struggle in these scenarios, particularly
when prior information is not available. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and transformer-based mechanisms for enhanced
multi-agent coordination and collective task execution. Our approach leverages
GNNs to model agent-agent and agent-goal interactions through adaptive graph
construction, enabling efficient information aggregation and decision-making
under constrained communication. A transformer-based message-passing mechanism,
augmented with edge-feature-enhanced attention, captures complex interaction
patterns, while a Double Deep Q-Network (Double DQN) with prioritized
experience replay optimizes agent policies in partially observable
environments. This integration is carefully designed to address specific
requirements of multi-agent navigation, such as scalability, adaptability, and
efficient task execution. Experimental results demonstrate superior
performance, with 90% service provisioning and 100% grid coverage (node
discovery), while reducing the average steps per episode to 200, compared to
600 for benchmark methods such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), greedy

<p class='card-text'>Unsupervised zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for pretraining behavioral foundation models (BFMs), enabling agents
to solve a wide range of downstream tasks specified via reward functions in a
zero-shot fashion, i.e., without additional test-time learning or planning.
This is achieved by learning self-supervised task embeddings alongside
corresponding near-optimal behaviors and incorporating an inference procedure
to directly retrieve the latent task embedding and associated policy for any
given reward function. Despite promising results, zero-shot policies are often
suboptimal due to errors induced by the unsupervised training process, the
embedding, and the inference procedure. In this paper, we focus on devising
fast adaptation strategies to improve the zero-shot performance of BFMs in a
few steps of online interaction with the environment while avoiding any
performance drop during the adaptation process. Notably, we demonstrate that
existing BFMs learn a set of skills containing more performant policies than
those identified by their inference procedure, making them well-suited for fast
adaptation. Motivated by this observation, we propose both actor-critic and
actor-only fast adaptation strategies that search in the low-dimensional
task-embedding space of the pre-trained BFM to rapidly improve the performance
of its zero-shot policies on any downstream task. Notably, our approach
mitigates the initial "unlearning" phase commonly observed when fine-tuning
pre-trained RL models. We evaluate our fast adaptation strategies on top of
four state-of-the-art zero-shot RL methods in multiple navigation and
locomotion domains. Our results show that they achieve 10-40% improvement over
their zero-shot performance in a few tens of episodes, outperforming existing
baselines.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-10 02:04:29</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper considers how to fuse Machine Learning (ML) and optimization to
solve large-scale Supply Chain Planning (SCP) optimization problems. These
problems can be formulated as MIP models which feature both integer
(non-binary) and continuous variables, as well as flow balance and capacity
constraints. This raises fundamental challenges for existing integrations of ML
and optimization that have focused on binary MIPs and graph problems. To
address these, the paper proposes PROPEL, a new framework that combines
optimization with both supervised and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to
reduce the size of search space significantly. PROPEL uses supervised learning,
not to predict the values of all integer variables, but to identify the
variables that are fixed to zero in the optimal solution, leveraging the
structure of SCP applications. PROPEL includes a DRL component that selects
which fixed-at-zero variables must be relaxed to improve solution quality when
the supervised learning step does not produce a solution with the desired
optimality tolerance. PROPEL has been applied to industrial supply chain
planning optimizations with millions of variables. The computational results
show dramatic improvements in solution times and quality, including a 60%
reduction in primal integral and an 88% primal gap reduction, and improvement
factors of up to 13.57 and 15.92, respectively.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful model-free
paradigm for learning optimal policies. However, in real-world navigation
tasks, DRL methods often suffer from insufficient exploration, particularly in
cluttered environments with sparse rewards or complex dynamics under system

planning with DRL, enabling agents to explore cluttered spaces more effectively
and achieve desired navigation performance. Specifically, we design a dense

learn the exact interpretable causal world models (CWMs). COMET first extracts
object-centric state descriptions from observations and identifies the
environment's internal states related to the depicted objects' properties.
Using symbolic regression, it models object-centric transitions and derives
causal relationships governing object dynamics. COMET further incorporates
large language models (LLMs) for semantic inference, annotating causal
variables to enhance interpretability.
  By leveraging these capabilities, COMET constructs CWMs that align with the
true causal structure of the environment, enabling agents to focus on
task-relevant features. The extracted CWMs mitigate the danger of shortcuts,
permitting the development of RL systems capable of better planning and
decision-making across dynamic scenarios. Our results, validated in Atari
environments such as Pong and Freeway, demonstrate the accuracy and robustness
of COMET, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between object-centric
reasoning and causal inference in reinforcement learning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>An embodied system must not only model the patterns of the external world but
also understand its own motion dynamics. A motion dynamic model is essential
for efficient skill acquisition and effective planning. In this work, we
introduce the neural motion simulator (MoSim), a world model that predicts the
future physical state of an embodied system based on current observations and
actions. MoSim achieves state-of-the-art performance in physical state
prediction and provides competitive performance across a range of downstream
tasks. This works shows that when a world model is accurate enough and performs
precise long-horizon predictions, it can facilitate efficient skill acquisition
in imagined worlds and even enable zero-shot reinforcement learning.
Furthermore, MoSim can transform any model-free reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithm into a model-based approach, effectively decoupling physical
environment modeling from RL algorithm development. This separation allows for
independent advancements in RL algorithms and world modeling, significantly
improving sample efficiency and enhancing generalization capabilities. Our
findings highlight that world models for motion dynamics is a promising
direction for developing more versatile and capable embodied systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Assistance games are a promising alternative to reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) for training AI assistants. Assistance games resolve key
drawbacks of RLHF, such as incentives for deceptive behavior, by explicitly
modeling the interaction between assistant and user as a two-player game where
the assistant cannot observe their shared goal. Despite their potential,
assistance games have only been explored in simple settings. Scaling them to
more complex environments is difficult because it requires both solving
intractable decision-making problems under uncertainty and accurately modeling
human users' behavior. We present the first scalable approach to solving
assistance games and apply it to a new, challenging Minecraft-based assistance
game with over $10^{400}$ possible goals. Our approach, AssistanceZero, extends
AlphaZero with a neural network that predicts human actions and rewards,
enabling it to plan under uncertainty. We show that AssistanceZero outperforms
model-free RL algorithms and imitation learning in the Minecraft-based
assistance game. In a human study, our AssistanceZero-trained assistant
significantly reduces the number of actions participants take to complete
building tasks in Minecraft. Our results suggest that assistance games are a
tractable framework for training effective AI assistants in complex
environments. Our code and models are available at

  Loco-manipulation</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Loco-manipulation -- coordinated locomotion and physical interaction with
objects -- remains a major challenge for legged robots due to the need for both
accurate force interaction and robustness to unmodeled dynamics. While
model-based controllers provide interpretable dynamics-level planning and
optimization, they are limited by model inaccuracies and computational cost. In
contrast, learning-based methods offer robustness while struggling with precise
modulation of interaction forces. We introduce RAMBO -- RL-Augmented
Model-Based Optimal Control -- a hybrid framework that integrates model-based
reaction force optimization using a simplified dynamics model and a feedback
policy trained with reinforcement learning. The model-based module generates
feedforward torques by solving a quadratic program, while the policy provides
feedback residuals to enhance robustness in control execution. We validate our
framework on a quadruped robot across a diverse set of real-world
loco-manipulation tasks -- such as pushing a shopping cart, balancing a plate,
and holding soft objects -- in both quadrupedal and bipedal walking. Our
experiments demonstrate that RAMBO enables precise manipulation while achieving
robust and dynamic locomotion, surpassing the performance of policies trained
with end-to-end scheme. In addition, our method enables flexible trade-off
between end-effector tracking accuracy with compliance.</p>
