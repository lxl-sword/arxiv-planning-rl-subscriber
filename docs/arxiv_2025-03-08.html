  Manipulation with Large Language Models</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language
Models (VLMs) have significantly impacted robotics, enabling high-level
semantic motion planning applications. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
complementary paradigm, enables agents to autonomously optimize complex
behaviors through interaction and reward signals. However, designing effective
reward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks
where sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate
design. In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex
HumanInformed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4,
a pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language
task descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated
environments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance
feasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria,
creating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable
text into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive
simulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an
ABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness.
Tasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-05 10:12:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We offer a new in-depth investigation of global path planning (GPP) for
unmanned ground vehicles, an autonomous mining sampling robot named ROMIE. GPP
is essential for ROMIE's optimal performance, which is translated into solving
the traveling salesman problem, a complex graph theory challenge that is
crucial for determining the most effective route to cover all sampling
locations in a mining field. This problem is central to enhancing ROMIE's
operational efficiency and competitiveness against human labor by optimizing
cost and time. The primary aim of this research is to advance GPP by
developing, evaluating, and improving a cost-efficient software and web
application. We delve into an extensive comparison and analysis of Google
operations research (OR)-Tools optimization algorithms. Our study is driven by
the goal of applying and testing the limits of OR-Tools capabilities by
integrating Reinforcement Learning techniques for the first time. This enables
us to compare these methods with OR-Tools, assessing their computational
effectiveness and real-world application efficiency. Our analysis seeks to
provide insights into the effectiveness and practical application of each
technique. Our findings indicate that Q-Learning stands out as the optimal
strategy, demonstrating superior efficiency by deviating only 1.2% on average
from the optimal solutions across our datasets.</p>

  Navigation in Narrow Environment</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-05 05:53:08</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Autonomous navigation is a fundamental task for robot vacuum cleaners in
indoor environments. Since their core function is to clean entire areas, robots
inevitably encounter dead zones in cluttered and narrow scenarios. Existing
planning methods often fail to escape due to complex environmental constraints,
high-dimensional search spaces, and high difficulty maneuvers. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes an embodied escaping model that leverages
reinforcement learning-based policy with an efficient action mask for dead zone
escaping. To alleviate the issue of the sparse reward in training, we introduce
a hybrid training policy that improves learning efficiency. In handling
redundant and ineffective action options, we design a novel action
representation to reshape the discrete action space with a uniform turning
radius. Furthermore, we develop an action mask strategy to select valid action
quickly, balancing precision and efficiency. In real-world experiments, our
robot is equipped with a Lidar, IMU, and two-wheel encoders. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments across varying difficulty levels
demonstrate that our robot can consistently escape from challenging dead zones.
Moreover, our approach significantly outperforms compared path planning and
reinforcement learning methods in terms of success rate and collision
avoidance.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-04 08:05:14</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Efficient path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is crucial in
remote sensing and information collection. As task scales expand, the
cooperative deployment of multiple UAVs significantly improves information
collection efficiency. However, collaborative communication and decision-making
for multiple UAVs remain major challenges in path planning, especially in noisy
environments. To efficiently accomplish complex information collection tasks in
3D space and address robust communication issues, we propose a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for UAV path planning based on the
Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients (COMA) algorithm. The framework
incorporates attention mechanism-based UAV communication protocol and
training-deployment system, significantly improving communication robustness
and individual decision-making capabilities in noisy conditions. Experiments
conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing algorithms in terms of path planning efficiency and
robustness, especially in noisy environments, achieving a 78\% improvement in
entropy reduction.</p>

  Agricultural Vehicle Routing Optimization</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Yixuan Fan, Haotian Xu, Mengqiao Liu, Qing Zhuo, Tao Zhang</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-04 07:50:32</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The Entrance Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem (EDVRP) is a variant of the
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) where the scale of cities influences routing
outcomes, necessitating consideration of their entrances. This paper addresses
EDVRP in agriculture, focusing on multi-parameter vehicle planning for
irregularly shaped fields. To address the limitations of traditional methods,
such as heuristic approaches, which often overlook field geometry and entrance
constraints, we propose a Joint Probability Distribution Sampling Neural
Network (JPDS-NN) to effectively solve the EDVRP. The network uses an
encoder-decoder architecture with graph transformers and attention mechanisms
to model routing as a Markov Decision Process, and is trained via reinforcement
learning for efficient and rapid end-to-end planning. Experimental results
indicate that JPDS-NN reduces travel distances by 48.4-65.4%, lowers fuel
consumption by 14.0-17.6%, and computes two orders of magnitude faster than
baseline methods, while demonstrating 15-25% superior performance in dynamic
arrangement scenarios. Ablation studies validate the necessity of
cross-attention and pre-training. The framework enables scalable, intelligent
routing for large-scale farming under dynamic constraints.</p>

<h4 class='card-title'><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02189v1' target='_blank'>Adaptive Traffic Signal Control based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning. Case Study on a simulated real-world corridor</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Dickness Kakitahi Kwesiga, Angshuman Guin, Michael Hunter</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-04 01:54:44</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The very few studies that have attempted to formulate multi-agent
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control have
mainly used value-based RL methods although recent literature has shown that
policy-based methods may perform better in partially observable environments.
Additionally, because of the simplifying assumptions on signal timing made
almost universally across previous studies, RL methods remain largely untested
for real-world signal timing plans. This study formulates a multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO) algorithm to implement adaptive and
coordinated traffic control along an arterial corridor. The formulated MA-PPO
has centralized critic architecture under the centralized training and
decentralized execution framework. All agents are formulated to allow selection
and implementation of up to eight signal phases as commonly implemented in the
field controllers. The formulated algorithm is tested on a simulated real-world
corridor with seven intersections, actual/complete traffic movements and signal
phases, traffic volumes, and network geometry including intersection spacings.
The performance of the formulated MA-PPO adaptive control algorithm is compared
with the field implemented coordinated and actuated signal control (ASC) plans
modeled using Vissim-MaxTime software in the loop simulation (SILs). The speed
of convergence for each agent largely depended on the size of the action space
which in turn depended on the number and sequence of signal phases. Compared
with the currently implemented ASC signal timings, MA-PPO showed a travel time
reduction of about 14% and 29%, respectively for the two through movements
across the entire test corridor. Through volume sensitivity experiments, the
formulated MA-PPO showed good stability, robustness and adaptability to changes
in traffic demand.</p>

  Reinforcement Learning with Guidance Points</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Qianyi Zhang, Wentao Luo, Boyi Liu, Ziyang Zhang, Yaoyuan Wang, Jingtai Liu</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-03 22:53:06</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Motion planning in navigation systems is highly susceptible to upstream
perceptual errors, particularly in human detection and tracking. To mitigate
this issue, the concept of guidance points--a novel directional cue within a
reinforcement learning-based framework--is introduced. A structured method for
identifying guidance points is developed, consisting of obstacle boundary
extraction, potential guidance point detection, and redundancy elimination. To
integrate guidance points into the navigation pipeline, a
perception-to-planning mapping strategy is proposed, unifying guidance points
with other perceptual inputs and enabling the RL agent to effectively leverage
the complementary relationships among raw laser data, human detection and
tracking, and guidance points. Qualitative and quantitative simulations
demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the highest success rate and
near-optimal travel times, greatly improving both safety and efficiency.
Furthermore, real-world experiments in dynamic corridors and lobbies validate
the robot's ability to confidently navigate around obstacles and robustly avoid
pedestrians.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-03 13:54:56</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Path planning for robotic exploration is challenging, requiring reasoning
over unknown spaces and anticipating future observations. Efficient exploration
requires selecting budget-constrained paths that maximize information gain.
Despite advances in autonomous exploration, existing algorithms still fall
short of human performance, particularly in structured environments where
predictive cues exist but are underutilized. Guided by insights from our user
study, we introduce MapExRL, which improves robot exploration efficiency in
structured indoor environments by enabling longer-horizon planning through
reinforcement learning (RL) and global map predictions. Unlike many RL-based
exploration methods that use motion primitives as the action space, our
approach leverages frontiers for more efficient model learning and longer
horizon reasoning. Our framework generates global map predictions from the
observed map, which our policy utilizes, along with the prediction uncertainty,
estimated sensor coverage, frontier distance, and remaining distance budget, to
assess the strategic long-term value of frontiers. By leveraging multiple
frontier scoring methods and additional context, our policy makes more informed
decisions at each stage of the exploration. We evaluate our framework on a
real-world indoor map dataset, achieving up to an 18.8% improvement over the
strongest state-of-the-art baseline, with even greater gains compared to
conventional frontier-based algorithms.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In recent research advancements within the community, large language models
(LLMs) have sparked great interest in creating autonomous agents. However,
current prompt-based agents often heavily rely on large-scale LLMs. Meanwhile,
although fine-tuning methods significantly enhance the capabilities of smaller
LLMs, the fine-tuned agents often lack the potential for self-reflection and
self-improvement. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel agent
framework named RetroAct, which is a framework that jointly optimizes both
task-planning and self-reflective evolution capabilities in language agents.
Specifically, we develop a two-stage joint optimization process that integrates
imitation learning and reinforcement learning, and design an off-policy joint
policy gradient optimization algorithm with imitation learning regularization
to enhance the data efficiency and training stability in agent tasks. RetroAct
significantly improves the performance of open-source models, reduces
dependency on closed-source LLMs, and enables fine-tuned agents to learn and
evolve continuously. We conduct extensive experiments across various testing
environments, demonstrating RetroAct has substantial improvements in task
performance and decision-making processes.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-01 22:58:44</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In reinforcement learning (RL), world models serve as internal simulators,
enabling agents to predict environment dynamics and future outcomes in order to
make informed decisions. While previous approaches leveraging discrete latent
spaces, such as DreamerV3, have demonstrated strong performance in discrete
action settings and visual control tasks, their comparative performance in
state-based continuous control remains underexplored. In contrast, methods with
continuous latent spaces, such as TD-MPC2, have shown notable success in
state-based continuous control benchmarks. In this paper, we demonstrate that
modeling discrete latent states has benefits over continuous latent states and
that discrete codebook encodings are more effective representations for
continuous control, compared to alternative encodings, such as one-hot and
label-based encodings. Based on these insights, we introduce DCWM: Discrete
Codebook World Model, a self-supervised world model with a discrete and
stochastic latent space, where latent states are codes from a codebook. We
combine DCWM with decision-time planning to get our model-based RL algorithm,
named DC-MPC: Discrete Codebook Model Predictive Control, which performs
competitively against recent state-of-the-art algorithms, including TD-MPC2 and
DreamerV3, on continuous control benchmarks. See our project website

  bandits</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Lily Xu, Bryan Wilder, Elias B. Khalil, Milind Tambe</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-01 21:25:21</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) has increasingly been applied to solve real-world
planning problems, with progress in handling large state spaces and time
horizons. However, a key bottleneck in many domains is that RL methods cannot
accommodate large, combinatorially structured action spaces. In such settings,
even representing the set of feasible actions at a single step may require a
complex discrete optimization formulation. We leverage recent advances in
embedding trained neural networks into optimization problems to propose
SEQUOIA, an RL algorithm that directly optimizes for long-term reward over the
feasible action space. Our approach embeds a Q-network into a mixed-integer
program to select a combinatorial action in each timestep. Here, we focus on
planning over restless bandits, a class of planning problems which capture many
real-world examples of sequential decision making. We introduce coRMAB, a
broader class of restless bandits with combinatorial actions that cannot be
decoupled across the arms of the restless bandit, requiring direct solving over
the joint, exponentially large action space. We empirically validate SEQUOIA on
four novel restless bandit problems with combinatorial constraints: multiple
interventions, path constraints, bipartite matching, and capacity constraints.
Our approach significantly outperforms existing methods -- which cannot address
sequential planning and combinatorial selection simultaneously -- by an average
of 26.4% on these difficult instances.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-01 15:31:14</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Diffusion models have recently shown significant potential in solving
decision-making problems, particularly in generating behavior plans -- also
known as diffusion planning. While numerous studies have demonstrated the
impressive performance of diffusion planning, the mechanisms behind the key
components of a good diffusion planner remain unclear and the design choices
are highly inconsistent in existing studies. In this work, we address this
issue through systematic empirical experiments on diffusion planning in an
offline reinforcement learning (RL) setting, providing practical insights into
the essential components of diffusion planning. We trained and evaluated over
6,000 diffusion models, identifying the critical components such as guided
sampling, network architecture, action generation and planning strategy. We
revealed that some design choices opposite to the common practice in previous
work in diffusion planning actually lead to better performance, e.g.,
unconditional sampling with selection can be better than guided sampling and
Transformer outperforms U-Net as denoising network. Based on these insights, we
suggest a simple yet strong diffusion planning baseline that achieves
state-of-the-art results on standard offline RL benchmarks.</p>

consideration is given to how to use these models for real-time or cooperative
jamming musical applications because of crucial required features: low latency,
the ability to communicate planned actions, and the ability to adapt to user
input in real-time. To support these needs, we introduce ReaLJam, an interface
and protocol for live musical jamming sessions between a human and a
Transformer-based AI agent trained with reinforcement learning. We enable
real-time interactions using the concept of anticipation, where the agent
continually predicts how the performance will unfold and visually conveys its

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-28 15:24:17</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Humans leverage rich internal models of the world to reason about the future,
imagine counterfactuals, and adapt flexibly to new situations. In Reinforcement
Learning (RL), world models aim to capture how the environment evolves in
response to the agent's actions, facilitating planning and generalization.
However, typical world models directly operate on the environment variables
(e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make their training slow and
cumbersome; instead, it may be advantageous to rely on high-level latent
dimensions that capture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace (GW)
Theory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information
broadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient
deep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an
RL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with
various versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We
show that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the
GW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps. As an
additional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its comparison
baselines) displays strong robustness to the absence of one of its observation
modalities (images or simulation attributes). We conclude that the combination
of GW with World Models holds great potential for improving decision-making in
RL agents.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Stable and robust robotic grasping is essential for current and future robot
applications. In recent works, the use of large datasets and supervised

reinforcement learning combined with tactile sensing is a promising direction.
Yet, there is no systematic evaluation of how the complexity of force-based
tactile sensing affects the learning behavior for grasping tasks. This paper
compares various tactile and environmental setups using two model-free
reinforcement learning approaches for antipodal grasping. Our findings suggest
that under imperfect visual perception, various tactile features improve

<p class='card-text'>In multi-robot exploration, a team of mobile robot is tasked with efficiently
mapping an unknown environments. While most exploration planners assume
omnidirectional sensors like LiDAR, this is impractical for small robots such
as drones, where lightweight, directional sensors like cameras may be the only
option due to payload constraints. These sensors have a constrained
field-of-view (FoV), which adds complexity to the exploration problem,
requiring not only optimal robot positioning but also sensor orientation during
movement. In this work, we propose MARVEL, a neural framework that leverages
graph attention networks, together with novel frontiers and orientation
features fusion technique, to develop a collaborative, decentralized policy
using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for robots with constrained
FoV. To handle the large action space of viewpoints planning, we further
introduce a novel information-driven action pruning strategy. MARVEL improves
multi-robot coordination and decision-making in challenging large-scale indoor
environments, while adapting to various team sizes and sensor configurations
(i.e., FoV and sensor range) without additional training. Our extensive
evaluation shows that MARVEL's learned policies exhibit effective coordinated
behaviors, outperforming state-of-the-art exploration planners across multiple
metrics. We experimentally demonstrate MARVEL's generalizability in large-scale
environments, of up to 90m by 90m, and validate its practical applicability
through successful deployment on a team of real drone hardware.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for robot learning.
However, model-free RL (MFRL) requires a large number of environment
interactions to learn successful control policies. This is due to the noisy RL
training updates and the complexity of robotic systems, which typically involve
highly non-linear dynamics and noisy sensor signals. In contrast, model-based
RL (MBRL) not only trains a policy but simultaneously learns a world model that
captures the environment's dynamics and rewards. The world model can either be
used for planning, for data collection, or to provide first-order policy
gradients for training. Leveraging a world model significantly improves sample
efficiency compared to model-free RL. However, training a world model alongside
the policy increases the computational complexity, leading to longer training
times that are often intractable for complex real-world scenarios. In this
work, we propose a new method for accelerating model-based RL using state-space
world models. Our approach leverages state-space models (SSMs) to parallelize
the training of the dynamics model, which is typically the main computational
bottleneck. Additionally, we propose an architecture that provides privileged
information to the world model during training, which is particularly relevant
for partially observable environments. We evaluate our method in several
real-world agile quadrotor flight tasks, involving complex dynamics, for both
fully and partially observable environments. We demonstrate a significant
speedup, reducing the world model training time by up to 10 times, and the
overall MBRL training time by up to 4 times. This benefit comes without
compromising performance, as our method achieves similar sample efficiency and
task rewards to state-of-the-art MBRL methods.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Trajectory planning is vital for autonomous driving, ensuring safe and
efficient navigation in complex environments. While recent learning-based
methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in
specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and
managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive
\textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The
auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the
incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining
coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a
generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an
invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy
performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework
effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance
enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory
planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based
state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset
nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA
approaches within this demanding dataset.</p>
