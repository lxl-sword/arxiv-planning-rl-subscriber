  with Self-Play and Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Hui Wang</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-27 16:52:25</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant
advancements in natural language processing (NLP), with strong capa-bilities in
generation, comprehension, and rea-soning. These models have found applications
in education, intelligent decision-making, and gaming. However, effectively
utilizing LLMs for strategic planning and decision-making in the game of Gomoku
remains a challenge. This study aims to develop a Gomoku AI system based on
LLMs, simulating the human learning process of playing chess. The system is
de-signed to understand and apply Gomoku strat-egies and logic to make rational
decisions. The research methods include enabling the model to "read the board,"
"understand the rules," "select strategies," and "evaluate positions," while
en-hancing its abilities through self-play and rein-forcement learning. The
results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the se-lection of
move positions, resolves the issue of generating illegal positions, and reduces
pro-cess time through parallel position evaluation. After extensive self-play
training, the model's Gomoku-playing capabilities have been notably enhanced.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Several hierarchical reinforcement learning methods leverage planning to
create a graph or sequences of intermediate goals, guiding a lower-level
goal-conditioned (GC) policy to reach some final goals. The low-level policy is
typically conditioned on the current goal, with the aim of reaching it as
quickly as possible. However, this approach can fail when an intermediate goal
can be reached in multiple ways, some of which may make it impossible to
continue toward subsequent goals. To address this issue, we introduce two
instances of Markov Decision Process (MDP) where the optimization objective
favors policies that not only reach the current goal but also subsequent ones.
In the first, the agent is conditioned on both the current and final goals,
while in the second, it is conditioned on the next two goals in the sequence.
We conduct a series of experiments on navigation and pole-balancing tasks in
which sequences of intermediate goals are given. By evaluating policies trained
with TD3+HER on both the standard GC-MDP and our proposed MDPs, we show that,
in most cases, conditioning on the next two goals improves stability and sample
efficiency over other approaches.</p>

  Ultrasound</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Accurate segmentation of nodules in both 2D breast ultrasound (BUS) and 3D
automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is crucial for clinical diagnosis and
treatment planning. Therefore, developing an automated system for nodule
segmentation can enhance user independence and expedite clinical analysis.
Unlike fully-supervised learning, weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) can
streamline the laborious and intricate annotation process. However, current WSS
methods face challenges in achieving precise nodule segmentation, as many of
them depend on inaccurate activation maps or inefficient pseudo-mask generation
algorithms. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement
learning-based WSS framework called Flip Learning, which relies solely on 2D/3D
boxes for accurate segmentation. Specifically, multiple agents are employed to
erase the target from the box to facilitate classification tag flipping, with
the erased region serving as the predicted segmentation mask. The key
contributions of this research are as follows: (1) Adoption of a
superpixel/supervoxel-based approach to encode the standardized environment,
capturing boundary priors and expediting the learning process. (2) Introduction
of three meticulously designed rewards, comprising a classification score
reward and two intensity distribution rewards, to steer the agents' erasing
process precisely, thereby avoiding both under- and over-segmentation. (3)
Implementation of a progressive curriculum learning strategy to enable agents
to interact with the environment in a progressively challenging manner, thereby
enhancing learning efficiency. Extensively validated on the large in-house BUS
and ABUS datasets, our Flip Learning method outperforms state-of-the-art WSS
methods and foundation models, and achieves comparable performance as
fully-supervised learning algorithms.</p>

  Placement and Migration in Hybrid Storage Systems</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Hybrid storage systems (HSS) combine multiple storage devices with diverse
characteristics to achieve high performance and capacity at low cost. The
performance of an HSS highly depends on the effectiveness of two key policies:
(1) the data-placement policy, which determines the best-fit storage device for
incoming data, and (2) the data-migration policy, which rearranges stored data
across the devices to sustain high HSS performance. Prior works focus on
improving only data placement or only data migration in HSS, which leads to
sub-optimal HSS performance. Unfortunately, no prior work tries to optimize
both policies together. Our goal is to design a holistic data-management
technique for HSS that optimizes both data-placement and data-migration
policies to fully exploit the potential of an HSS. We propose Harmonia, a
multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based data-management technique that
employs two light-weight autonomous RL agents, a data-placement agent and a
data-migration agent, which adapt their policies for the current workload and
HSS configuration, and coordinate with each other to improve overall HSS
performance. We evaluate Harmonia on a real HSS with up to four heterogeneous
storage devices with diverse characteristics. Our evaluation using 17
data-intensive workloads on performance-optimized (cost-optimized) HSS with two
storage devices shows that, on average, Harmonia (1) outperforms the
best-performing prior approach by 49.5% (31.7%), (2) bridges the performance
gap between the best-performing prior work and Oracle by 64.2% (64.3%). On an
HSS with three (four) devices, Harmonia outperforms the best-performing prior
work by 37.0% (42.0%). Harmonia's performance benefits come with low latency
(240ns for inference) and storage overheads (206 KiB for both RL agents
together). We plan to open-source Harmonia's implementation to aid future
research on HSS.</p>

  Socially-Aware Robot Navigation</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Kevin Alcedo, Pedro U. Lima, Rachid Alami</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-26 10:59:08</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Navigating in environments alongside humans requires agents to reason under
uncertainty and account for the beliefs and intentions of those around them.
Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can
naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social
navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others,
inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP),
where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of
Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based
reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the
challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a
perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on
Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.</p>

  Learning</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has demonstrated superior sample
efficiency compared to model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). However, the
presence of inaccurate models can introduce biases during policy learning,
resulting in misleading trajectories. The challenge lies in obtaining accurate
models due to limited diverse training data, particularly in regions with
limited visits (uncertain regions). Existing approaches passively quantify
uncertainty after sample generation, failing to actively collect uncertain
samples that could enhance state coverage and improve model accuracy. Moreover,
MBRL often faces difficulties in making accurate multi-step predictions,
thereby impacting overall performance. To address these limitations, we propose
a novel framework for uncertainty-aware policy optimization with model-based
exploratory planning. In the model-based planning phase, we introduce an
uncertainty-aware k-step lookahead planning approach to guide action selection
at each step. This process involves a trade-off analysis between model
uncertainty and value function approximation error, effectively enhancing
policy performance. In the policy optimization phase, we leverage an
uncertainty-driven exploratory policy to actively collect diverse training
samples, resulting in improved model accuracy and overall performance of the RL
agent. Our approach offers flexibility and applicability to tasks with varying
state/action spaces and reward structures. We validate its effectiveness
through experiments on challenging robotic manipulation tasks and Atari games,
surpassing state-of-the-art methods with fewer interactions, thereby leading to
significant performance improvements.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Zergham Ahmed, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Christopher J. Bates, Samuel J. Gershman</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in complex environments, such as video games. However, they still
fall short of achieving human-like sample efficiency and adaptability when
learning new domains. Theory-based reinforcement learning (TBRL) is an
algorithmic framework specifically designed to address this gap. Modeled on
cognitive theories, TBRL leverages structured, causal world models - "theories"
- as forward simulators for use in planning, generalization and exploration.
Although current TBRL systems provide compelling explanations of how humans
learn to play video games, they face several technical limitations: their
theory languages are restrictive, and their planning algorithms are not
scalable. To address these challenges, we introduce TheoryCoder, an
instantiation of TBRL that exploits hierarchical representations of theories
and efficient program synthesis methods for more powerful learning and
planning. TheoryCoder equips agents with general-purpose abstractions (e.g.,
"move to"), which are then grounded in a particular environment by learning a
low-level transition model (a Python program synthesized from observations by a
large language model). A bilevel planning algorithm can exploit this
hierarchical structure to solve large domains. We demonstrate that this
approach can be successfully applied to diverse and challenging grid-world
games, where approaches based on directly synthesizing a policy perform poorly.
Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of using hierarchical abstractions.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In this study, we formulate the drone delivery problem as a control problem

first is on a less challenging grid world environment with lower

Reinforcement Learning (MARL): Independent $Q$-Learning (IQL), Joint Action

<p class='card-text'>Automatic parameter tuning methods for planning algorithms, which integrate
pipeline approaches with learning-based techniques, are regarded as promising
due to their stability and capability to handle highly constrained
environments. While existing parameter tuning methods have demonstrated
considerable success, further performance improvements require a more
structured approach. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical architecture for
reinforcement learning-based parameter tuning. The architecture introduces a
hierarchical structure with low-frequency parameter tuning, mid-frequency
planning, and high-frequency control, enabling concurrent enhancement of both
upper-layer parameter tuning and lower-layer control through iterative
training. Experimental evaluations in both simulated and real-world
environments show that our method surpasses existing parameter tuning
approaches. Furthermore, our approach achieves first place in the Benchmark for

<p class='card-text'>Human-Object Interaction (HOI) is vital for advancing simulation, animation,
and robotics, enabling the generation of long-term, physically plausible
motions in 3D environments. However, existing methods often fall short of
achieving physics realism and supporting diverse types of interactions. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces a unified Human-Object
Interaction framework that provides unified control over interactions with
static scenes and dynamic objects using language commands. The interactions
between human and object parts can always be described as the continuous stable
Relative Movement Dynamics (RMD) between human and object parts. By leveraging
the world knowledge and scene perception capabilities of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), we translate language commands into RMD diagrams, which are used to
guide goal-conditioned reinforcement learning for sequential interaction with
objects. Our framework supports long-horizon interactions among dynamic,
articulated, and static objects. To support the training and evaluation of our
framework, we present a new dataset named Interplay, which includes multi-round
task plans generated by VLMs, covering both static and dynamic HOI tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively
handle a wide range of HOI tasks, showcasing its ability to maintain long-term,
multi-round transitions. For more details, please refer to our project webpage:

<p class='card-text'>Active Inference (AIF) is emerging as a powerful framework for
decision-making under uncertainty, yet its potential in engineering
applications remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose a novel
dual-layer AIF architecture that addresses both building-level and

each layer adapts to evolving conditions and handles partial observability
without extensive sensor information and respecting data privacy. We validate
the continuous AIF model against both a perfect optimization baseline and a
reinforcement learning-based approach. We also test the community AIF framework
under extreme pricing scenarios. The results highlight the model's robustness

<p class='card-text'>This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based planning scheme
for optimized robotic management of biotic stresses in precision agriculture.
The framework employs a hierarchical decision-making structure with conditional
action masking, where high-level actions direct the robot's exploration, while
low-level actions optimize its navigation and efficient chemical spraying in
affected areas. The key objectives of optimization include improving the
coverage of infected areas with limited battery power and reducing chemical
usage, thus preventing unnecessary spraying of healthy areas of the field. Our
numerical experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method,
Hierarchical Action Masking Proximal Policy Optimization (HAM-PPO),
significantly outperforms baseline practices, such as LawnMower navigation +
indiscriminate spraying (Carpet Spray), in terms of yield recovery and resource

  Offline Resource Allocation Planner in Clustered Ad Hoc Networks</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Kechen Meng, Sinuo Zhang, Rongpeng Li, Chan Wang, Ming Lei, Zhifeng Zhao</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-22 08:27:09</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Due to network delays and scalability limitations, clustered ad hoc networks
widely adopt Reinforcement Learning (RL) for on-demand resource allocation.
Albeit its demonstrated agility, traditional Model-Free RL (MFRL) solutions
struggle to tackle the huge action space, which generally explodes
exponentially along with the number of resource allocation units, enduring low
sampling efficiency and high interaction cost. In contrast to MFRL, Model-Based
RL (MBRL) offers an alternative solution to boost sample efficiency and
stabilize the training by explicitly leveraging a learned environment model.
However, establishing an accurate dynamic model for complex and noisy
environments necessitates a careful balance between model accuracy and
computational complexity $\&$ stability. To address these issues, we propose a
Conditional Diffusion Model Planner (CDMP) for high-dimensional offline
resource allocation in clustered ad hoc networks. By leveraging the astonishing
generative capability of Diffusion Models (DMs), our approach enables the
accurate modeling of high-quality environmental dynamics while leveraging an
inverse dynamics model to plan a superior policy. Beyond simply adopting DMs in
offline RL, we further incorporate the CDMP algorithm with a theoretically
guaranteed, uncertainty-aware penalty metric, which theoretically and
empirically manifests itself in mitigating the Out-of-Distribution
(OOD)-induced distribution shift issue underlying scarce training data.
Extensive experiments also show that our model outperforms MFRL in average

<p class='card-text'>Radiotherapy treatment planning is a complex and time-intensive process,
often impacted by inter-planner variability and subjective decision-making. To
address these challenges, we introduce Dose Optimization Language Agent (DOLA),
an autonomous large language model (LLM)-based agent designed for optimizing
radiotherapy treatment plans while rigorously protecting patient privacy. DOLA
integrates the LLaMa3.1 LLM directly with a commercial treatment planning
system, utilizing chain-of-thought prompting, retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG), and reinforcement learning (RL). Operating entirely within secure local
infrastructure, this agent eliminates external data sharing. We evaluated DOLA
using a retrospective cohort of 18 prostate cancer patients prescribed 60 Gy in
20 fractions, comparing model sizes (8 billion vs. 70 billion parameters) and
optimization strategies (No-RAG, RAG, and RAG+RL) over 10 planning iterations.
The 70B model demonstrated significantly improved performance, achieving
approximately 16.4% higher final scores than the 8B model. The RAG approach
outperformed the No-RAG baseline by 19.8%, and incorporating RL accelerated
convergence, highlighting the synergy of retrieval-based memory and
reinforcement learning. Optimal temperature hyperparameter analysis identified
0.4 as providing the best balance between exploration and exploitation. This
proof of concept study represents the first successful deployment of locally
hosted LLM agents for autonomous optimization of treatment plans within a
commercial radiotherapy planning system. By extending human-machine interaction
through interpretable natural language reasoning, DOLA offers a scalable and
privacy-conscious framework, with significant potential for clinical

<p class='card-text'>In this work, we augment reinforcement learning with an inference-time

waste-sorting facility with limited processing capacity. Each container has two
optimal emptying volumes that trade off higher throughput against overflow
risk. Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches struggle under
delayed rewards, sparse critical events, and high-dimensional uncertainty --
failing to consistently balance higher-volume empties with the risk of
safety-limit violations. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid
method comprising: (1) a curriculum-learning pipeline that incrementally trains
a PPO agent to handle delayed rewards and class imbalance, and (2) an offline
pairwise collision model used at inference time to proactively avert collisions
with minimal online cost. Experimental results show that our targeted
inference-time collision checks significantly improve collision avoidance,
reduce safety-limit violations, maintain high throughput, and scale effectively

<p class='card-text'>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become a promising solution for
structural health monitoring (SHM), especially in hard-to-reach or remote
locations. Battery-powered WSNs offer various advantages over wired systems,
however limited battery life has always been one of the biggest obstacles in
practical use of the WSNs, regardless of energy harvesting methods. While
various methods have been studied for battery health management, existing
methods exclusively aim to extend lifetime of individual batteries, lacking a
system level view. A consequence of applying such methods is that batteries in
a WSN tend to fail at different times, posing significant difficulty on
planning and scheduling of battery replacement trip. This study investigate a
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for active battery degradation
management by optimizing duty cycle of WSNs at the system level. This active
management strategy effectively reduces earlier failure of battery individuals
which enable group replacement without sacrificing WSN performances. A
simulated environment based on a real-world WSN setup was developed to train a
DRL agent and learn optimal duty cycle strategies. The performance of the
strategy was validated in a long-term setup with various network sizes,

<p class='card-text'>In the field of robotics many different approaches ranging from classical
planning over optimal control to reinforcement learning (RL) are developed and
borrowed from other fields to achieve reliable control in diverse tasks. In
order to get a clear understanding of their individual strengths and weaknesses
and their applicability in real world robotic scenarios is it important to
benchmark and compare their performances not only in a simulation but also on
real hardware. The '2nd AI Olympics with RealAIGym' competition was held at the
IROS 2024 conference to contribute to this cause and evaluate different
controllers according to their ability to solve a dynamic control problem on an
underactuated double pendulum system with chaotic dynamics. This paper
describes the four different RL methods submitted by the participating teams,
presents their performance in the swing-up task on a real double pendulum,
measured against various criteria, and discusses their transferability from
simulation to real hardware and their robustness to external disturbances.</p>

  Learning and iLQR</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>The driving risk field is applicable to more complex driving scenarios,
providing new approaches for safety decision-making and active vehicle control
in intricate environments. However, existing research often overlooks the
driving risk field and fails to consider the impact of risk distribution within
drivable areas on trajectory planning, which poses challenges for enhancing
safety. This paper proposes a trajectory planning method for intelligent
vehicles based on the risk reachable set to further improve the safety of
trajectory planning. First, we construct the reachable set incorporating the
driving risk field to more accurately assess and avoid potential risks in
drivable areas. Then, the initial trajectory is generated based on safe
reinforcement learning and projected onto the reachable set. Finally, we
introduce a trajectory planning method based on a constrained iterative
quadratic regulator to optimize the initial solution, ensuring that the planned
trajectory achieves optimal comfort, safety, and efficiency. We conduct
simulation tests of trajectory planning in high-speed lane-changing scenarios.
The results indicate that the proposed method can guarantee trajectory comfort
and driving efficiency, with the generated trajectory situated outside
high-risk boundaries, thereby ensuring vehicle safety during operation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning on text and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are highly effective for visual perception,
applying those models for visual instruction-based planning remains a widely
open problem. In this paper, we introduce VIPER, a novel framework for
multimodal instruction-based planning that integrates VLM-based perception with
LLM-based reasoning. Our approach uses a modular pipeline where a frozen VLM
generates textual descriptions of image observations, which are then processed
by an LLM policy to predict actions based on the task goal. We fine-tune the
reasoning module using behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning, improving
our agent's decision-making capabilities. Experiments on the ALFWorld benchmark
show that VIPER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visual
instruction-based planners while narrowing the gap with purely text-based
oracles. By leveraging text as an intermediate representation, VIPER also
enhances explainability, paving the way for a fine-grained analysis of
perception and reasoning components.</p>

  Control</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Jeff Jewett, Sandhya Saisubramanian</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Decision-making in complex, continuous multi-task environments is often
hindered by the difficulty of obtaining accurate models for planning and the
inefficiency of learning purely from trial and error. While precise environment
dynamics may be hard to specify, human experts can often provide high-fidelity
abstractions that capture the essential high-level structure of a task and user
preferences in the target environment. Existing hierarchical approaches often
target discrete settings and do not generalize across tasks. We propose a
hierarchical reinforcement learning approach that addresses these limitations
by dynamically planning over the expert-specified abstraction to generate
subgoals to learn a goal-conditioned policy. To overcome the challenges of
learning under sparse rewards, we shape the reward based on the optimal state
value in the abstract model. This structured decision-making process enhances
sample efficiency and facilitates zero-shot generalization. Our empirical
evaluation on a suite of procedurally generated continuous control environments
demonstrates that our approach outperforms existing hierarchical reinforcement
learning methods in terms of sample efficiency, task completion rate,
scalability to complex tasks, and generalization to novel scenarios.</p>
