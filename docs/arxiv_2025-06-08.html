<p class='card-text'>Multi-part assembly poses significant challenges for robots to execute
long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation with generalization across complex
geometries. We present Fabrica, a dual-arm robotic system capable of end-to-end
planning and control for autonomous assembly of general multi-part objects. For
planning over long horizons, we develop hierarchies of precedence, sequence,
grasp, and motion planning with automated fixture generation, enabling general
multi-step assembly on any dual-arm robots. The planner is made efficient
through a parallelizable design and is optimized for downstream control
stability. For contact-rich assembly steps, we propose a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that trains generalist policies across object
geometries, assembly directions, and grasp poses, guided by equivariance and
residual actions obtained from the plan. These policies transfer zero-shot to
the real world and achieve 80% successful steps. For systematic evaluation, we
propose a benchmark suite of multi-part assemblies resembling industrial and
daily objects across diverse categories and geometries. By integrating
efficient global planning and robust local control, we showcase the first
system to achieve complete and generalizable real-world multi-part assembly
without domain knowledge or human demonstrations. Project website:

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.</p>

  Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-05 07:53:59</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.</p>

<p class='card-text'>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities, they often struggle with complex tasks that require specific
thinking paradigms, such as divide-and-conquer and procedural deduction, \etc
Previous researches integrate external, reliable tools to alleviate logical
inconsistencies and hallucinations in LLMs' problem-solving processes. However,
we argue that the root challenge is more profound: LLMs lack the complex
thinking paradigms (\ie, computational thinking) during reasoning. In this
paper, we propose Computational Thinking Model (CTM), a novel framework that
incorporates computational thinking paradigms into LLMs. This framework enables
LLMs to reformulate complex problems through decomposition, abstraction,
reduction, and simulation, among other techniques. Specifically, live code
execution is seamlessly integrated into the reasoning process, allowing CTM to
think by computing. CTM directly instills computational thinking objectives
into LLMs through tailored reinforcement learning rewards, which encourages
problem simplification, modular planning, and iterative verification. We
conduct extensive evaluations on multiple code generation and mathematical
benchmarks. The results demonstrate that CTM outperforms conventional reasoning
models and tool-augmented baselines in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and
generalizability. We hope this study offers valuable insights for AI reasoning,
where LLMs can transform problems into robust, verifiable, and scalable
computational workflows, much like computer scientists do.</p>

  Learning for Smart Public Safety UAV</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Yousef Emami, Hao Zhou, Miguel Gutierrez Gaitan, Kai Li, Luis Almeida, Zhu Han</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-03 09:01:33</h6>
<p class='card-text'>A public safety Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) enhances situational awareness
in emergency response. Its agility and ability to optimize mobility and
establish Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication make it increasingly vital for
managing emergencies such as disaster response, search and rescue, and wildfire
monitoring. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied to
optimize UAV navigation and control, its high training complexity, low sample
efficiency, and simulation-to-reality gap limit its practicality in public
safety. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling
alternative. With strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can
adapt to new tasks through In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task
adaptation via natural language prompts and example-based guidance, without
retraining. Deploying LLMs at the network edge, rather than in the cloud,
further reduces latency and preserves data privacy, thereby making them
suitable for real-time, mission-critical public safety UAVs. This paper
proposes the integration of LLM-enabled ICL with public safety UAV to address
the key functions, such as path planning and velocity control, in the context
of emergency response. We present a case study on data collection scheduling
where the LLM-enabled ICL framework can significantly reduce packet loss
compared to conventional approaches, while also mitigating potential
jailbreaking vulnerabilities. Finally, we discuss LLM optimizers and specify
future research directions. The ICL framework enables adaptive, context-aware
decision-making for public safety UAV, thus offering a lightweight and
efficient solution for enhancing UAV autonomy and responsiveness in
emergencies.</p>

  Local Planning and Proactive Global Planning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Arnab Debnath, Gregory J. Stein, Jana Kosecka</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-03 08:12:55</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We consider the problem of indoor building-scale social navigation, where the
robot must reach a point goal as quickly as possible without colliding with
humans who are freely moving around. Factors such as varying crowd densities,
unpredictable human behavior, and the constraints of indoor spaces add
significant complexity to the navigation task, necessitating a more advanced
approach. We propose a modular navigation framework that leverages the
strengths of both classical methods and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our
approach employs a global planner to generate waypoints, assigning soft costs
around anticipated pedestrian locations, encouraging caution around potential
future positions of humans. Simultaneously, the local planner, powered by DRL,
follows these waypoints while avoiding collisions. The combination of these
planners enables the agent to perform complex maneuvers and effectively
navigate crowded and constrained environments while improving reliability. Many
existing studies on social navigation are conducted in simplistic or open
environments, limiting the ability of trained models to perform well in
complex, real-world settings. To advance research in this area, we introduce a
new 2D benchmark designed to facilitate development and testing of social
navigation strategies in indoor environments. We benchmark our method against
traditional and RL-based navigation strategies, demonstrating that our approach
outperforms both.</p>

  Uncertainty-Informed Action Selection</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Nils Dengler, Jesper Mücke, Rohit Menon, Maren Bennewitz</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-02 21:57:53</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Service robots operating in cluttered human environments such as homes,
offices, and schools cannot rely on predefined object arrangements and must
continuously update their semantic and spatial estimates while dealing with
possible frequent rearrangements. Efficient and accurate mapping under such
conditions demands selecting informative viewpoints and targeted manipulations
to reduce occlusions and uncertainty. In this work, we present a
manipulation-enhanced semantic mapping framework for occlusion-heavy shelf
scenes that integrates evidential metric-semantic mapping with
reinforcement-learning-based next-best view planning and targeted action
selection. Our method thereby exploits uncertainty estimates from the Dirichlet
and Beta distributions in the semantic and occupancy prediction networks to
guide both active sensor placement and object manipulation, focusing on areas
of limited knowledge and selecting actions with high expected information gain.
For object manipulation, we introduce an uncertainty-informed push strategy
that targets occlusion-critical objects and generates minimally invasive
actions to reveal hidden regions. The experimental evaluation shows that our
framework highly reduces object displacement and drops while achieving a 95%
reduction in planning time compared to the state-of-the-art, thereby realizing
real-world applicability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Most existing safe reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks focus on robotics
and control tasks, offering limited relevance to high-stakes domains that
involve structured constraints, mixed-integer decisions, and industrial
complexity. This gap hinders the advancement and deployment of safe RL in
critical areas such as energy systems, manufacturing, and supply chains. To
address this limitation, we present SafeOR-Gym, a benchmark suite of nine
operations research (OR) environments tailored for safe RL under complex
constraints. Each environment captures a realistic planning, scheduling, or
control problems characterized by cost-based constraint violations, planning
horizons, and hybrid discrete-continuous action spaces. The suite integrates
seamlessly with the Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) interface
provided by OmniSafe. We evaluate several state-of-the-art safe RL algorithms
across these environments, revealing a wide range of performance: while some
tasks are tractable, others expose fundamental limitations in current
approaches. SafeOR-Gym provides a challenging and practical testbed that aims

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-02 08:57:37</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven breakthroughs in AI, from game-play to
scientific discovery and AI alignment. However, its broader applicability
remains limited by challenges such as low data efficiency and poor
generalizability. Recent advances suggest that large language models, with
their rich world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, could complement RL by
enabling semantic state modeling and task-agnostic planning. In this work, we
propose the Agentic Episodic Control (AEC), a novel architecture that
integrates RL with LLMs to enhance decision-making. The AEC can leverage a
large language model (LLM) to map the observations into language-grounded
embeddings, which further can be stored in an episodic memory for rapid
retrieval of high-value experiences. Simultaneously, a World-Graph working
memory module is utilized to capture structured environmental dynamics in order
to enhance relational reasoning. Furthermore, a lightweight critical state
detector dynamically arbitrates between the episodic memory recall and the
world-model-guided exploration. On the whole, by combining the trial-and-error
learning scheme with LLM-derived semantic priors, the proposed AEC can improve
both data efficiency and generalizability in reinforcement learning. In
experiments on BabyAI-Text benchmark tasks, AEC demonstrates substantial
improvements over existing baselines, especially on complex and generalization
tasks like FindObj, where it outperforms the best baseline by up to 76%. The
proposed AEC framework bridges the strengths of numeric reinforcement learning
and symbolic reasoning, which provides a pathway toward more adaptable and

face significant challenges in spectrum management, interference mitigation,
and real-time coordination across dynamic and resource-constrained

elements for enabling intelligent LAE networks as follows machine

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-01 09:11:24</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Bayesian posterior sampling techniques have demonstrated superior empirical
performance in many exploration-exploitation settings. However, their
theoretical analysis remains a challenge, especially in complex settings like
reinforcement learning. In this paper, we introduce Q-Learning with Posterior
Sampling (PSQL), a simple Q-learning-based algorithm that uses Gaussian
posteriors on Q-values for exploration, akin to the popular Thompson Sampling
algorithm in the multi-armed bandit setting. We show that in the tabular
episodic MDP setting, PSQL achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(H^2\sqrt{SAT})$, closely matching the known lower bound of
$\Omega(H\sqrt{SAT})$. Here, S, A denote the number of states and actions in
the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), and $T=KH$ with $K$ being the
number of episodes and $H$ being the planning horizon. Our work provides
several new technical insights into the core challenges in combining posterior

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-06-01 08:32:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for
long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline
datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality
and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to
tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To
overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching
(SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally
stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse
and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving
latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the
environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by
directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent
space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and
generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned
benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore,
augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance
of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse

<p class='card-text'>Recent advances in diffusion-based generative modeling have demonstrated
significant promise in tackling long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks by leveraging
offline datasets. While these approaches have achieved promising results, their
reliability remains inconsistent due to the inherent stochastic risk of
producing infeasible trajectories, limiting their applicability in
safety-critical applications. We identify that the primary cause of these
failures is inaccurate guidance during the sampling procedure, and demonstrate
the existence of manifold deviation by deriving a lower bound on the guidance
gap. To address this challenge, we propose Local Manifold Approximation and
Projection (LoMAP), a training-free method that projects the guided sample onto
a low-rank subspace approximated from offline datasets, preventing infeasible
trajectory generation. We validate our approach on standard offline
reinforcement learning benchmarks that involve challenging long-horizon
planning. Furthermore, we show that, as a standalone module, LoMAP can be

<p class='card-text'>Previous research has sought to enhance the graph reasoning capabilities of
LLMs by supervised fine-tuning on synthetic graph data. While these led to
specialized LLMs better at solving graph algorithm problems, we don't need LLMs
for shortest path: we need generalization from synthetic graph data to
real-world tasks with implicit graph structures. In this work, we propose to
unlock generalizable learning of graph synthetic data with reinforcement
learning. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for
synthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in
direct fine-tuning, we posit that RL would help LLMs grasp the essentials
underlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting. We employ RL algorithms
such as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on
synthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both
in-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit
graph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our RL recipe leads to statistically significant
improvement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9\% over baseline
settings. Further analysis reveals that process-based rewards consistently
outperform solution-based rewards, mixing synthetic and real-world task data
yields potential gains, while compositionality and explainable intermediate

work, we explore the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to develop stroke
patterns for targeted navigation in a three-link swimmer model at low Reynolds
numbers. Specifically, we design two RL-based strategies: one focusing on
maximizing velocity (Velocity-Focused Strategy) and another balancing velocity
with energy consumption (Energy-Aware Strategy). Our results demonstrate how
the use of different reward functions influences the resulting stroke patterns
developed via RL, which are compared with those obtained from traditional
optimization methods. Furthermore, we showcase the capability of the RL-powered
swimmer in adapting its stroke patterns in performing different navigation
tasks, including tracing complex trajectories and pursuing moving targets.
Taken together, this work highlights the potential of reinforcement learning as
a versatile tool for designing efficient and adaptive microswimmers capable of
sophisticated maneuvers in complex environments.</p>

  Networked Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>This paper studies the networked multi-agent reinforcement learning (NMARL)
problem, where the objective of agents is to collaboratively maximize the
discounted average cumulative rewards. Different from the existing methods that
suffer from poor expression due to linear function approximation, we propose a
distributed neural policy gradient algorithm that features two innovatively
designed neural networks, specifically for the approximate Q-functions and
policy functions of agents. This distributed neural policy gradient algorithm
consists of two key components: the distributed critic step and the
decentralized actor step. In the distributed critic step, agents receive the
approximate Q-function parameters from their neighboring agents via a
time-varying communication networks to collaboratively evaluate the joint
policy. In contrast, in the decentralized actor step, each agent updates its
local policy parameter solely based on its own approximate Q-function. In the
convergence analysis, we first establish the global convergence of agents for
the joint policy evaluation in the distributed critic step. Subsequently, we
rigorously demonstrate the global convergence of the overall distributed neural
policy gradient algorithm with respect to the objective function. Finally, the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it with a
centralized algorithm through simulation in the robot path planning
environment.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise for
automating real-world tasks but struggle to transfer across domains due to
their domain-specific nature. Current approaches face two critical
shortcomings: they require complete architectural redesign and full retraining
of all components when applied to new domains. We introduce Workforce, a
hierarchical multi-agent framework that decouples strategic planning from
specialized execution through a modular architecture comprising: (i) a
domain-agnostic Planner for task decomposition, (ii) a Coordinator for subtask
management, and (iii) specialized Workers with domain-specific tool-calling
capabilities. This decoupling enables cross-domain transferability during both
inference and training phases: During inference, Workforce seamlessly adapts to
new domains by adding or modifying worker agents; For training, we introduce
Optimized Workforce Learning (OWL), which improves generalization across
domains by optimizing a domain-agnostic planner with reinforcement learning
from real-world feedback. To validate our approach, we evaluate Workforce on
the GAIA benchmark, covering various realistic, multi-domain agentic tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate Workforce achieves open-source
state-of-the-art performance (69.70%), outperforming commercial systems like
OpenAI's Deep Research by 2.34%. More notably, our OWL-trained 32B model
achieves 52.73% accuracy (+16.37%) and demonstrates performance comparable to
GPT-4o on challenging tasks. To summarize, by enabling scalable generalization
and modular domain transfer, our work establishes a foundation for the next
generation of general-purpose AI assistants.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Classical search algorithms have long underpinned modern artificial
intelligence. In this work, we tackle the challenge of inference-time control
in diffusion models -- adapting generated outputs to meet diverse test-time
objectives -- using principles from classical search. We propose a general
framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the
generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed
Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using
breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range
of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and
image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both
performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a
principled and practical foundation for inference-time scaling in diffusion
models. Project page at diffusion-inference-scaling.github.io.</p>
