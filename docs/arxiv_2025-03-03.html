<p class='card-text'>Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have created
models capable of high-quality musical content generation. However, little
consideration is given to how to use these models for real-time or cooperative
jamming musical applications because of crucial required features: low latency,
the ability to communicate planned actions, and the ability to adapt to user
input in real-time. To support these needs, we introduce ReaLJam, an interface
and protocol for live musical jamming sessions between a human and a
Transformer-based AI agent trained with reinforcement learning. We enable
real-time interactions using the concept of anticipation, where the agent
continually predicts how the performance will unfold and visually conveys its
plan to the user. We conduct a user study where experienced musicians jam in
real-time with the agent through ReaLJam. Our results demonstrate that ReaLJam
enables enjoyable and musically interesting sessions, and we uncover important
takeaways for future work.</p>

  Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Léopold Maytié, Roland Bertin Johannet, Rufin VanRullen</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-28 15:24:17</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Humans leverage rich internal models of the world to reason about the future,
imagine counterfactuals, and adapt flexibly to new situations. In Reinforcement
Learning (RL), world models aim to capture how the environment evolves in
response to the agent's actions, facilitating planning and generalization.
However, typical world models directly operate on the environment variables
(e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make their training slow and
cumbersome; instead, it may be advantageous to rely on high-level latent
dimensions that capture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace (GW)
Theory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information
broadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient
deep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an
RL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with
various versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We
show that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the
GW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps. As an
additional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its comparison
baselines) displays strong robustness to the absence of one of its observation
modalities (images or simulation attributes). We conclude that the combination
of GW with World Models holds great potential for improving decision-making in
RL agents.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-27 19:26:36</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, Reinforcement Learning (RL),
and Diffusion Models have each demonstrated strong performance in trajectory
optimization, decision-making, and motion planning. However, these approaches
have traditionally been treated as distinct methodologies with separate
optimization frameworks. In this work, we establish a unified perspective that
connects MPPI, RL, and Diffusion Models through gradient-based optimization on
the Gibbs measure. We first show that MPPI can be interpreted as performing
gradient ascent on a smoothed energy function. We then demonstrate that Policy
Gradient methods reduce to MPPI when treating policy parameters as control
variables under a fixed initial state. Additionally, we establish that the
reverse sampling process in diffusion models follows the same update rule as
MPPI.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Boya Zhang, Iris Andrussow, Andreas Zell, Georg Martius</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-27 18:36:37</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Stable and robust robotic grasping is essential for current and future robot
applications. In recent works, the use of large datasets and supervised
learning has enhanced speed and precision in antipodal grasping. However, these
methods struggle with perception and calibration errors due to large planning
horizons. To obtain more robust and reactive grasping motions, leveraging
reinforcement learning combined with tactile sensing is a promising direction.
Yet, there is no systematic evaluation of how the complexity of force-based
tactile sensing affects the learning behavior for grasping tasks. This paper
compares various tactile and environmental setups using two model-free
reinforcement learning approaches for antipodal grasping. Our findings suggest
that under imperfect visual perception, various tactile features improve
learning outcomes, while complex tactile inputs complicate training.</p>

  multi-robot Exploration in Large-scale environments</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Jimmy Chiun, Shizhe Zhang, Yizhuo Wang, Yuhong Cao, Guillaume Sartoretti</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-27 15:58:42</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In multi-robot exploration, a team of mobile robot is tasked with efficiently
mapping an unknown environments. While most exploration planners assume
omnidirectional sensors like LiDAR, this is impractical for small robots such
as drones, where lightweight, directional sensors like cameras may be the only
option due to payload constraints. These sensors have a constrained
field-of-view (FoV), which adds complexity to the exploration problem,
requiring not only optimal robot positioning but also sensor orientation during
movement. In this work, we propose MARVEL, a neural framework that leverages
graph attention networks, together with novel frontiers and orientation
features fusion technique, to develop a collaborative, decentralized policy
using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for robots with constrained
FoV. To handle the large action space of viewpoints planning, we further
introduce a novel information-driven action pruning strategy. MARVEL improves
multi-robot coordination and decision-making in challenging large-scale indoor
environments, while adapting to various team sizes and sensor configurations
(i.e., FoV and sensor range) without additional training. Our extensive
evaluation shows that MARVEL's learned policies exhibit effective coordinated
behaviors, outperforming state-of-the-art exploration planners across multiple
metrics. We experimentally demonstrate MARVEL's generalizability in large-scale
environments, of up to 90m by 90m, and validate its practical applicability
through successful deployment on a team of real drone hardware.</p>

  Models</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Maria Krinner, Elie Aljalbout, Angel Romero, Davide Scaramuzza</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-27 15:05:25</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for robot learning.
However, model-free RL (MFRL) requires a large number of environment
interactions to learn successful control policies. This is due to the noisy RL
training updates and the complexity of robotic systems, which typically involve
highly non-linear dynamics and noisy sensor signals. In contrast, model-based
RL (MBRL) not only trains a policy but simultaneously learns a world model that
captures the environment's dynamics and rewards. The world model can either be
used for planning, for data collection, or to provide first-order policy
gradients for training. Leveraging a world model significantly improves sample
efficiency compared to model-free RL. However, training a world model alongside
the policy increases the computational complexity, leading to longer training
times that are often intractable for complex real-world scenarios. In this
work, we propose a new method for accelerating model-based RL using state-space
world models. Our approach leverages state-space models (SSMs) to parallelize
the training of the dynamics model, which is typically the main computational
bottleneck. Additionally, we propose an architecture that provides privileged
information to the world model during training, which is particularly relevant
for partially observable environments. We evaluate our method in several
real-world agile quadrotor flight tasks, involving complex dynamics, for both
fully and partially observable environments. We demonstrate a significant
speedup, reducing the world model training time by up to 10 times, and the
overall MBRL training time by up to 4 times. This benefit comes without
compromising performance, as our method achieves similar sample efficiency and
task rewards to state-of-the-art MBRL methods.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-27 09:26:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Trajectory planning is vital for autonomous driving, ensuring safe and
efficient navigation in complex environments. While recent learning-based
methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in
specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and
managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive
\textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The
auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the
incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining
coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a
generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an
invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy
performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework
effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance
enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory
planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based
state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset
nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA
approaches within this demanding dataset.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-27 09:01:11</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated potential in addressing
robotic local planning problems, yet its efficacy remains constrained in highly
unstructured and dynamic environments. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the ColorDynamic framework. First, an end-to-end DRL formulation is
established, which maps raw sensor data directly to control commands, thereby
ensuring compatibility with unstructured environments. Under this formulation,
a novel network, Transqer, is introduced. The Transqer enables online DRL
learning from temporal transitions, substantially enhancing decision-making in
dynamic scenarios. To facilitate scalable training of Transqer with diverse
data, an efficient simulation platform E-Sparrow, along with a data
augmentation technique leveraging symmetric invariance, are developed.
Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, alongside assessments
of generalizability, scalability, and real-time performance, were conducted to
validate the effectiveness of ColorDynamic. Results indicate that our approach
achieves a success rate exceeding 90% while exhibiting real-time capacity
(1.2-1.3 ms per planning). Additionally, ablation studies were performed to
corroborate the contributions of individual components. Building on this, the
OkayPlan-ColorDynamic (OPCD) navigation system is presented, with simulated and
real-world experiments demonstrating its superiority and applicability in
complex scenarios. The codebase and experimental demonstrations have been

  Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Xinran Li, Xiaolu Wang, Chenjia Bai, Jun Zhang</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-27 03:15:31</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), well-designed
communication protocols can effectively facilitate consensus among agents,
thereby enhancing task performance. Moreover, in large-scale multi-agent
systems commonly found in real-world applications, effective communication
plays an even more critical role due to the escalated challenge of partial
observability compared to smaller-scale setups. In this work, we endeavor to
develop a scalable communication protocol for MARL. Unlike previous methods
that focus on selecting optimal pairwise communication links-a task that
becomes increasingly complex as the number of agents grows-we adopt a global
perspective on communication topology design. Specifically, we propose
utilizing the exponential topology to enable rapid information dissemination
among agents by leveraging its small-diameter and small-size properties. This
approach leads to a scalable communication protocol, named ExpoComm. To fully
unlock the potential of exponential graphs as communication topologies, we
employ memory-based message processors and auxiliary tasks to ground messages,
ensuring that they reflect global information and benefit decision-making.
Extensive experiments on large-scale cooperative benchmarks, including MAgent
and Infrastructure Management Planning, demonstrate the superior performance
and robust zero-shot transferability of ExpoComm compared to existing
communication strategies. The code is publicly available at

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-26 19:04:26</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The language generation and reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) have enabled conversational systems with impressive performance in a
variety of tasks, from code generation, to composing essays, to passing STEM
and legal exams, to a new paradigm for knowledge search. Besides those
short-term use applications, LLMs are increasingly used to help with real-life
goals or tasks that take a long time to complete, involving multiple sessions
across days, weeks, months, or even years. Thus to enable conversational
systems for long term interactions and tasks, we need language-based agents
that can plan for long horizons. Traditionally, such capabilities were
addressed by reinforcement learning agents with hierarchical planning
capabilities. In this work, we explore a novel architecture where the LLM acts
as the meta-controller deciding the agent's next macro-action, and tool use
augmented LLM-based option policies execute the selected macro-action. We
instantiate this framework for a specific set of macro-actions enabling
adaptive planning for users' personal plans through conversation and follow-up
questions collecting user feedback. We show how this paradigm can be applicable

  Wilderness Search and Rescue Planning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Jan-Hendrik Ewers, David Anderson, Douglas Thomson</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-26 17:54:47</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Wilderness search and rescue operations are often carried out over vast
landscapes. The search efforts, however, must be undertaken in minimum time to
maximize the chance of survival of the victim. Whilst the advent of cheap
multicopters in recent years has changed the way search operations are handled,
it has not solved the challenges of the massive areas at hand. The problem
therefore is not one of complete coverage, but one of maximizing the
information gathered in the limited time available. In this work we propose
that a combination of a recurrent autoencoder and deep reinforcement learning
is a more efficient solution to the search problem than previous pure deep
reinforcement learning or optimisation approaches. The autoencoder training
paradigm efficiently maximizes the information throughput of the encoder into
its latent space representation which deep reinforcement learning is primed to
leverage. Without the overhead of independently solving the problem that the
recurrent autoencoder is designed for, it is more efficient in learning the
control task. We further implement three additional architectures for a
comprehensive comparison of the main proposed architecture. Similarly, we apply
both soft actor-critic and proximal policy optimisation to provide an insight
into the performance of both in a highly non-linear and complex application
with a large observation Results show that the proposed architecture is vastly
superior to the benchmarks, with soft actor-critic achieving the best
performance. This model further outperformed work from the literature whilst
having below a fifth of the total learnable parameters and training in a
quarter of the time.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Industrial robots are widely used in diverse manufacturing environments.
Nonetheless, how to enable robots to automatically plan trajectories for
changing tasks presents a considerable challenge. Further complexities arise
when robots operate within work cells alongside machines, humans, or other
robots. This paper introduces a multi-level hybrid robot motion planning method
combining a task space Reinforcement Learning-based Learning from Demonstration
(RL-LfD) agent and a joint-space based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based
agent. A higher level agent learns to switch between the two agents to enable
feasible and smooth motion. The feasibility is computed by incorporating
reachability, joint limits, manipulability, and collision risks of the robot in
the given environment. Therefore, the derived hybrid motion planning policy
generates a feasible trajectory that adheres to task constraints. The
effectiveness of the method is validated through sim ulated robotic scenarios

<p class='card-text'>Recent studies have shown that Transformers can perform in-context
reinforcement learning (RL) by imitating existing RL algorithms, enabling
sample-efficient adaptation to unseen tasks without parameter updates. However,
these models also inherit the suboptimal behaviors of the RL algorithms they
imitate. This issue primarily arises due to the gradual update rule employed by
those algorithms. Model-based planning offers a promising solution to this
limitation by allowing the models to simulate potential outcomes before taking
action, providing an additional mechanism to deviate from the suboptimal
behavior. Rather than learning a separate dynamics model, we propose
Distillation for In-Context Planning (DICP), an in-context model-based RL
framework where Transformers simultaneously learn environment dynamics and
improve policy in-context. We evaluate DICP across a range of discrete and
continuous environments, including Darkroom variants and Meta-World. Our
results show that DICP achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous parking has become a critical application in automatic driving
research and development. Parking operations often suffer from limited space
and complex environments, requiring accurate perception and precise
maneuvering. Traditional rule-based parking algorithms struggle to adapt to
diverse and unpredictable conditions, while learning-based algorithms lack
consistent and stable performance in various scenarios. Therefore, a hybrid
approach is necessary that combines the stability of rule-based methods and the
generalizability of learning-based methods. Recently, reinforcement learning
(RL) based policy has shown robust capability in planning tasks. However, the
simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer gap seriously blocks the
real-world deployment. To address these problems, we employ a hybrid policy,
consisting of a rule-based Reeds-Shepp (RS) planner and a learning-based
reinforcement learning (RL) planner. A real-time LiDAR-based Occupancy Grid Map

hybrid policy can be applied to real-world systems seamlessly. We conducted
extensive experiments both in the simulation environment and real-world

<p class='card-text'>Current robots face challenges in manipulation tasks that require a long
sequence of prehensile and non-prehensile skills. This involves handling
contact-rich interactions and chaining multiple skills while considering their
long-term consequences. This paper presents a framework that leverages
imitation learning to distill a planning algorithm, capable of solving
long-horizon problems but requiring extensive computation time, into a policy
for efficient action inference. We introduce $\texttt{Skill-RRT}$, an extension
of the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) that incorporates skill
applicability checks and intermediate object pose sampling for efficient
long-horizon planning. To enable skill chaining, we propose
$\textit{connectors}$, goal-conditioned policies that transition between skills
while minimizing object disturbance. Using lazy planning, connectors are
selectively trained on relevant transitions, reducing the cost of training.
High-quality demonstrations are generated with $\texttt{Skill-RRT}$ and refined
by a noise-based replay mechanism to ensure robust policy performance. The
distilled policy, trained entirely in simulation, zero-shot transfer to the

on a predefined graph with fixed distance metrics. In contrast, safe
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors without relying on
manual heuristics but fails to solve long-horizon tasks, particularly in
goal-conditioned and multi-agent scenarios.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel method that integrates the strengths of
both planning and safe RL. Our method leverages goal-conditioned RL and safe RL
to learn a goal-conditioned policy for navigation while concurrently estimating
cumulative distance and safety levels using learned value functions via an
automated self-training algorithm. By constructing a graph with states from the
replay buffer, our method prunes unsafe edges and generates a waypoint-based
plan that the agent follows until reaching its goal, effectively balancing
faster and safer routes over extended distances.
  Utilizing this unified high-level graph and a shared low-level
goal-conditioned safe RL policy, we extend this approach to address the
multi-agent safe navigation problem. In particular, we leverage Conflict-Based
Search (CBS) to create waypoint-based plans for multiple agents allowing for
their safe navigation over extended horizons. This integration enhances the
scalability of goal-conditioned safe RL in multi-agent scenarios, enabling
efficient coordination among agents.
  Extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method in achieving distance goals safely for multiple
agents in complex and hazardous environments. Our code will be released to
support future research.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This thesis concerns the use of reinforcement learning to train neural
networks to aid in the design of public transit networks. The Transit Network
Design Problem (TNDP) is an optimization problem of considerable practical
importance. Given a city with an existing road network and travel demands, the
goal is to find a set of transit routes - each of which is a path through the
graph - that collectively satisfy all demands, while minimizing a cost function
that may depend both on passenger satisfaction and operating costs. The
existing literature on this problem mainly considers metaheuristic optimization
algorithms, such as genetic algorithms and ant-colony optimization. By
contrast, we begin by taking a reinforcement learning approach, formulating the
construction of a set of transit routes as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and
training a neural net policy to act as the agent in this MDP. We then show
that, beyond using this policy to plan a transit network directly, it can be
combined with existing metaheuristic algorithms, both to initialize the
solution and to suggest promising moves at each step of a search through
solution space. We find that such hybrid algorithms, which use a neural policy
trained via reinforcement learning as a core component within a classical
metaheuristic framework, can plan transit networks that are superior to those
planned by either the neural policy or the metaheuristic algorithm. We
demonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to redesign the transit
network for the city of Laval, Quebec, and show that in simulation, the
resulting transit network provides better service at lower cost than the
existing transit network.</p>

  Robot Learning in Natural Human-Robot Interaction</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advances in multimodal Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) datasets
emphasize the integration of speech and gestures, allowing robots to absorb
explicit knowledge and tacit understanding. However, existing datasets
primarily focus on elementary tasks like object pointing and pushing, limiting
their applicability to complex domains. They prioritize simpler human command
data but place less emphasis on training robots to correctly interpret tasks
and respond appropriately. To address these gaps, we present the NatSGLD
dataset, which was collected using a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) method, where
participants interacted with a robot they believed to be autonomous. NatSGLD
records humans' multimodal commands (speech and gestures), each paired with a
demonstration trajectory and a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula that
provides a ground-truth interpretation of the commanded tasks. This dataset
serves as a foundational resource for research at the intersection of HRI and
machine learning. By providing multimodal inputs and detailed annotations,
NatSGLD enables exploration in areas such as multimodal instruction following,
plan recognition, and human-advisable reinforcement learning from
demonstrations. We release the dataset and code under the MIT License at
https://www.snehesh.com/natsgld/ to support future HRI research.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Planning with options -- a sequence of primitive actions -- has been shown
effective in reinforcement learning within complex environments. Previous
studies have focused on planning with predefined options or learned options
through expert demonstration data. Inspired by MuZero, which learns superhuman
heuristics without any human knowledge, we propose a novel approach, named
OptionZero. OptionZero incorporates an option network into MuZero, providing
autonomous discovery of options through self-play games. Furthermore, we modify
the dynamics network to provide environment transitions when using options,
allowing searching deeper under the same simulation constraints. Empirical
experiments conducted in 26 Atari games demonstrate that OptionZero outperforms
MuZero, achieving a 131.58% improvement in mean human-normalized score. Our
behavior analysis shows that OptionZero not only learns options but also
acquires strategic skills tailored to different game characteristics. Our
findings show promising directions for discovering and using options in
planning. Our code is available at
https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/optionzero.</p>
