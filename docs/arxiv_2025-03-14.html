<p class='card-text'>Generating human-like and adaptive trajectories is essential for autonomous
driving in dynamic environments. While generative models have shown promise in
synthesizing feasible trajectories, they often fail to capture the nuanced
variability of human driving styles due to dataset biases and distributional
shifts. To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven
finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion
planning with diverse driving preferences. TrajHF incorporates
multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to
refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation
learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while
maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves PDMS of 93.95
on NavSim benchmark, significantly exceeding other methods. TrajHF sets a new
paradigm for personalized and adaptable trajectory generation in autonomous
driving.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In motion simulation, motion cueing algorithms are used for the trajectory
planning of the motion simulator platform, where workspace limitations prevent
direct reproduction of reference trajectories. Strategies such as motion
washout, which return the platform to its center, are crucial in these
settings. For serial robotic MSPs with highly nonlinear workspaces, it is
essential to maximize the efficient utilization of the MSPs kinematic and
dynamic capabilities. Traditional approaches, including classical washout
filtering and linear model predictive control, fail to consider
platform-specific, nonlinear properties, while nonlinear model predictive
control, though comprehensive, imposes high computational demands that hinder
real-time, pilot-in-the-loop application without further simplification. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach using deep
reinforcement learning for motion cueing, demonstrated here for the first time
in a 6-degree-of-freedom setting with full consideration of the MSPs kinematic
nonlinearities. Previous work by the authors successfully demonstrated the
application of DRL to a simplified 2-DOF setup, which did not consider
kinematic or dynamic constraints. This approach has been extended to all 6 DOF
by incorporating a complete kinematic model of the MSP into the algorithm, a
crucial step for enabling its application on a real motion simulator. The
training of the DRL-MCA is based on Proximal Policy Optimization in an
actor-critic implementation combined with an automated hyperparameter
optimization. After detailing the necessary training framework and the
algorithm itself, we provide a comprehensive validation, demonstrating that the
DRL MCA achieves competitive performance against established algorithms.
Moreover, it generates feasible trajectories by respecting all system
constraints and meets all real-time requirements with low...</p>

<h4 class='card-title'><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09758v1' target='_blank'>Multi-Agent LLM Actor-Critic Framework for Social Robot Navigation</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Weizheng Wang, Ike Obi, Byung-Cheol Min</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-12 18:59:53</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Recent advances in robotics and large language models (LLMs) have sparked
growing interest in human-robot collaboration and embodied intelligence. To
enable the broader deployment of robots in human-populated environments,
socially-aware robot navigation (SAN) has become a key research area. While
deep reinforcement learning approaches that integrate human-robot interaction
(HRI) with path planning have demonstrated strong benchmark performance, they
often struggle to adapt to new scenarios and environments. LLMs offer a
promising avenue for zero-shot navigation through commonsense inference.
However, most existing LLM-based frameworks rely on centralized
decision-making, lack robust verification mechanisms, and face inconsistencies
in translating macro-actions into precise low-level control signals. To address
these challenges, we propose SAMALM, a decentralized multi-agent LLM
actor-critic framework for multi-robot social navigation. In this framework, a
set of parallel LLM actors, each reflecting distinct robot personalities or
configurations, directly generate control signals. These actions undergo a
two-tier verification process via a global critic that evaluates group-level
behaviors and individual critics that assess each robot's context. An
entropy-based score fusion mechanism further enhances self-verification and
re-query, improving both robustness and coordination. Experimental results
confirm that SAMALM effectively balances local autonomy with global oversight,
yielding socially compliant behaviors and strong adaptability across diverse
multi-robot scenarios. More details and videos about this work are available

  Proving</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-12 18:20:47</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The most promising recent methods for AI reasoning require applying variants
of reinforcement learning (RL) either on rolled out trajectories from the
model, even for the step-wise rewards, or large quantities of human annotated
trajectory data. The reliance on the rolled-out trajectory renders the compute
cost and time prohibitively high. In particular, the correctness of a reasoning
trajectory can typically only be judged at its completion, leading to sparse
rewards in RL or requiring expensive synthetic data generation in expert
iteration-like methods. In this work, we focus on the Automatic Theorem Proving
(ATP) task and propose a novel verifier-in-the-loop design, which unlike
existing approaches that leverage feedback on the entire reasoning trajectory,
employs an automated verifier to give intermediate feedback at each step of the
reasoning process. Using Lean as the verifier, we empirically show that the
step-by-step local verification produces a global improvement in the model's
reasoning accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-12 16:05:31</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Recent research on Reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sought to
further enhance their performance by integrating meta-thinking -- enabling
models to monitor, evaluate, and control their reasoning processes for more
adaptive and effective problem-solving. However, current single-agent work
lacks a specialized design for acquiring meta-thinking, resulting in low
efficacy. To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforced Meta-thinking
Agents (ReMA), a novel framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL) to elicit meta-thinking behaviors, encouraging LLMs to think
about thinking. ReMA decouples the reasoning process into two hierarchical
agents: a high-level meta-thinking agent responsible for generating strategic
oversight and plans, and a low-level reasoning agent for detailed executions.
Through iterative reinforcement learning with aligned objectives, these agents
explore and learn collaboration, leading to improved generalization and
robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that ReMA outperforms single-agent
RL baselines on complex reasoning tasks, including competitive-level
mathematical benchmarks and LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks. Comprehensive ablation
studies further illustrate the evolving dynamics of each distinct agent,
providing valuable insights into how the meta-thinking reasoning process
enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In recent years, research on humanoid robots has garnered increasing
attention. With breakthroughs in various types of artificial intelligence
algorithms, embodied intelligence, exemplified by humanoid robots, has been
highly anticipated. The advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
have significantly improved the motion control and generalization capabilities
of humanoid robots. Simultaneously, the groundbreaking progress in large
language models (LLM) and visual language models (VLM) has brought more
possibilities and imagination to humanoid robots. LLM enables humanoid robots
to understand complex tasks from language instructions and perform long-term
task planning, while VLM greatly enhances the robots' understanding and
interaction with their environment. This paper introduces
\textcolor{magenta}{Trinity}, a novel AI system for humanoid robots that
integrates RL, LLM, and VLM. By combining these technologies, Trinity enables
efficient control of humanoid robots in complex environments. This innovative
approach not only enhances the capabilities but also opens new avenues for

<p class='card-text'>OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1 achieve or even surpass human expert-level
performance in complex domains like mathematics and science, with reinforcement
learning (RL) and reasoning playing a crucial role. In autonomous driving,
recent end-to-end models have greatly improved planning performance but still
struggle with long-tailed problems due to limited common sense and reasoning
abilities. Some studies integrate vision-language models (VLMs) into autonomous
driving, but they typically rely on pre-trained models with simple supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on driving data, without further exploration of training
strategies or optimizations specifically tailored for planning. In this paper,
we propose AlphaDrive, a RL and reasoning framework for VLMs in autonomous
driving. AlphaDrive introduces four GRPO-based RL rewards tailored for planning
and employs a two-stage planning reasoning training strategy that combines SFT
with RL. As a result, AlphaDrive significantly improves both planning
performance and training efficiency compared to using only SFT or without
reasoning. Moreover, we are also excited to discover that, following RL
training, AlphaDrive exhibits some emergent multimodal planning capabilities,
which is critical for improving driving safety and efficiency. To the best of
our knowledge, AlphaDrive is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with planning
reasoning into autonomous driving. Code will be released to facilitate future

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-10 14:58:16</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Autonomous navigation in intelligent mobile systems represents a core
research focus within artificial intelligence-driven robotics. Contemporary
path planning approaches face constraints in dynamic environmental
responsiveness and multi-objective task scalability, limiting their capacity to
address growing intelligent operation requirements. Decision-centric
reinforcement learning frameworks, capitalizing on their unique strengths in
adaptive environmental interaction and self-optimization, have gained
prominence in advanced control system research. This investigation introduces
methodological improvements to address sample homogeneity challenges in
reinforcement learning experience replay mechanisms. By incorporating
determinant point processes (DPP) for diversity assessment, we develop a
dual-criteria sampling framework with adaptive selection protocols. This
approach resolves representation bias in conventional prioritized experience
replay (PER) systems while preserving algorithmic interoperability, offering
improved decision optimization for dynamic operational scenarios. Key
contributions comprise: Develop a hybrid sampling paradigm (PER-DPP) combining
priority sequencing with diversity maximization.Based on this,create an
integrated optimization scheme (PER-DPP-Elastic DQN) merging diversity-aware
sampling with adaptive step-size regulation. Comparative simulations in 2D
navigation scenarios demonstrate that the elastic step-size component
temporarily delays initial convergence speed but synergistically enhances
final-stage optimization with PER-DPP integration. The synthesized method
generates navigation paths with optimized length efficiency and directional
stability.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Building predictive models for tabular data presents fundamental challenges,
notably in scaling consistently, i.e., more resources translating to better
performance, and generalizing systematically beyond the training data
distribution. Designing decision tree models remains especially challenging
given the intractably large search space, and most existing methods rely on
greedy heuristics, while deep learning inductive biases expect a temporal or
spatial structure not naturally present in tabular data. We propose a hybrid
amortized structure inference approach to learn predictive decision tree
ensembles given data, formulating decision tree construction as a sequential
planning problem. We train a deep reinforcement learning (GFlowNet) policy to
solve this problem, yielding a generative model that samples decision trees
from the Bayesian posterior. We show that our approach, DT-GFN, outperforms
state-of-the-art decision tree and deep learning methods on standard
classification benchmarks derived from real-world data, robustness to
distribution shifts, and anomaly detection, all while yielding interpretable
models with shorter description lengths. Samples from the trained DT-GFN model
can be ensembled to construct a random forest, and we further show that the
performance of scales consistently in ensemble size, yielding ensembles of

<p class='card-text'>The capture of flying MAVs (micro aerial vehicles) has garnered increasing
research attention due to its intriguing challenges and promising applications.
Despite recent advancements, a key limitation of existing work is that capture
strategies are often relatively simple and constrained by platform performance.
This paper addresses control strategies capable of capturing
high-maneuverability targets. The unique challenge of achieving target capture
under unstable conditions distinguishes this task from traditional
pursuit-evasion and guidance problems. In this study, we transition from larger
MAV platforms to a specially designed, compact capture MAV equipped with a
custom launching device while maintaining high maneuverability. We explore both
time-optimal planning (TOP) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods.
Simulations demonstrate that TOP offers highly maneuverable and shorter
trajectories, while RL excels in real-time adaptability and stability.
Moreover, the RL method has been tested in real-world scenarios, successfully
achieving target capture even in unstable states.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-09 08:38:10</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promising advancements in
sequential decision-making tasks through task-specific fine-tuning. However,
common fine-tuning methods, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO),
present notable limitations: SFT assumes Independent and Identically
Distributed (IID) data, while PPO focuses on maximizing cumulative rewards.
These limitations often restrict solution diversity and hinder generalization
in multi-step reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce a
novel framework, GFlowVLM, a framework that fine-tune VLMs using Generative
Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to promote generation of diverse solutions for
complex reasoning tasks. GFlowVLM models the environment as a non-Markovian
decision process, allowing it to capture long-term dependencies essential for
real-world applications. It takes observations and task descriptions as inputs
to prompt chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning which subsequently guides action
selection. We use task based rewards to fine-tune VLM with GFlowNets. This
approach enables VLMs to outperform prior fine-tuning methods, including SFT
and RL. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of GFlowVLM on complex
tasks such as card games (NumberLine, BlackJack) and embodied planning tasks
(ALFWorld), showing enhanced training efficiency, solution diversity, and
stronger generalization capabilities across both in-distribution and

<p class='card-text'>Recent developments in sequential experimental design look to construct a
policy that can efficiently navigate the design space, in a way that maximises
the expected information gain. Whilst there is work on achieving tractable
policies for experimental design problems, there is significantly less work on
obtaining policies that are able to generalise well - i.e. able to give good
performance despite a change in the underlying statistical properties of the
experiments. Conducting experiments sequentially has recently brought about the
use of reinforcement learning, where an agent is trained to navigate the design
space to select the most informative designs for experimentation. However,
there is still a lack of understanding about the benefits and drawbacks of
using certain reinforcement learning algorithms to train these agents. In our
work, we investigate several reinforcement learning algorithms and their
efficacy in producing agents that take maximally informative design decisions
in sequential experimental design scenarios. We find that agent performance is

<p class='card-text'>Green hydrogen has multiple use cases and is produced from renewable energy,
such as solar or wind energy. It can be stored in large quantities, decoupling
renewable energy generation from its use, and is therefore considered essential
for achieving a climate-neutral economy. The intermittency of renewable energy
generation and the stochastic nature of demand are, however, challenging
factors for the dynamic planning of hydrogen storage and transportation. This
holds particularly in the early-adoption phase when hydrogen distribution
occurs through vehicle-based networks. We therefore address the Dynamic
Inventory Routing Problem (DIRP) under stochastic supply and demand with direct
deliveries for the vehicle-based distribution of hydrogen. To solve this
problem, we propose a Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework that
integrates constraints into the learning process and incorporates parameterized
post-decision state value predictions. Additionally, we introduce
Lookahead-based CRL (LCRL), which improves decision-making over a multi-period
horizon to enhance short-term planning while maintaining the value predictions.
Our computational experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CRL and LCRL across
diverse instances. Our learning methods provide near-optimal solutions on small
scale instances that are solved via value iteration. Furthermore, both methods
outperform typical deep learning approaches such as Proximal Policy
Optimization, as well as classical inventory heuristics, such as
(s,S)-policy-based and Power-of-Two-based heuristics. Furthermore, LCRL
achieves a 10% improvement over CRL on average, albeit with higher
computational requirements. Analyses of optimal replenishment policies reveal
that accounting for stochastic supply and demand influences these policies,
showing the importance of our addition to the DIRP.</p>

reward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks
where sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous navigation is a fundamental task for robot vacuum cleaners in
indoor environments. Since their core function is to clean entire areas, robots
inevitably encounter dead zones in cluttered and narrow scenarios. Existing
planning methods often fail to escape due to complex environmental constraints,
high-dimensional search spaces, and high difficulty maneuvers. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes an embodied escaping model that leverages
reinforcement learning-based policy with an efficient action mask for dead zone
escaping. To alleviate the issue of the sparse reward in training, we introduce
a hybrid training policy that improves learning efficiency. In handling
redundant and ineffective action options, we design a novel action
representation to reshape the discrete action space with a uniform turning
radius. Furthermore, we develop an action mask strategy to select valid action
quickly, balancing precision and efficiency. In real-world experiments, our
robot is equipped with a Lidar, IMU, and two-wheel encoders. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments across varying difficulty levels
demonstrate that our robot can consistently escape from challenging dead zones.

<p class='card-text'>Efficient path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is crucial in
remote sensing and information collection. As task scales expand, the
cooperative deployment of multiple UAVs significantly improves information
collection efficiency. However, collaborative communication and decision-making
for multiple UAVs remain major challenges in path planning, especially in noisy
environments. To efficiently accomplish complex information collection tasks in
3D space and address robust communication issues, we propose a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for UAV path planning based on the
Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients (COMA) algorithm. The framework
incorporates attention mechanism-based UAV communication protocol and
training-deployment system, significantly improving communication robustness
and individual decision-making capabilities in noisy conditions. Experiments
conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing algorithms in terms of path planning efficiency and
robustness, especially in noisy environments, achieving a 78\% improvement in
entropy reduction.</p>

  Agricultural Vehicle Routing Optimization</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>The Entrance Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem (EDVRP) is a variant of the
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) where the scale of cities influences routing
outcomes, necessitating consideration of their entrances. This paper addresses
EDVRP in agriculture, focusing on multi-parameter vehicle planning for
irregularly shaped fields. To address the limitations of traditional methods,
such as heuristic approaches, which often overlook field geometry and entrance
constraints, we propose a Joint Probability Distribution Sampling Neural
Network (JPDS-NN) to effectively solve the EDVRP. The network uses an
encoder-decoder architecture with graph transformers and attention mechanisms
to model routing as a Markov Decision Process, and is trained via reinforcement
learning for efficient and rapid end-to-end planning. Experimental results
indicate that JPDS-NN reduces travel distances by 48.4-65.4%, lowers fuel
consumption by 14.0-17.6%, and computes two orders of magnitude faster than
baseline methods, while demonstrating 15-25% superior performance in dynamic
arrangement scenarios. Ablation studies validate the necessity of
cross-attention and pre-training. The framework enables scalable, intelligent
routing for large-scale farming under dynamic constraints.</p>

  Learning. Case Study on a simulated real-world corridor</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Dickness Kakitahi Kwesiga, Angshuman Guin, Michael Hunter</h6>

<p class='card-text'>The very few studies that have attempted to formulate multi-agent
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control have
mainly used value-based RL methods although recent literature has shown that
policy-based methods may perform better in partially observable environments.
Additionally, because of the simplifying assumptions on signal timing made
almost universally across previous studies, RL methods remain largely untested
for real-world signal timing plans. This study formulates a multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO) algorithm to implement adaptive and
coordinated traffic control along an arterial corridor. The formulated MA-PPO
has centralized critic architecture under the centralized training and
decentralized execution framework. All agents are formulated to allow selection
and implementation of up to eight signal phases as commonly implemented in the
field controllers. The formulated algorithm is tested on a simulated real-world
corridor with seven intersections, actual/complete traffic movements and signal
phases, traffic volumes, and network geometry including intersection spacings.
The performance of the formulated MA-PPO adaptive control algorithm is compared
with the field implemented coordinated and actuated signal control (ASC) plans
modeled using Vissim-MaxTime software in the loop simulation (SILs). The speed
of convergence for each agent largely depended on the size of the action space
which in turn depended on the number and sequence of signal phases. Compared
with the currently implemented ASC signal timings, MA-PPO showed a travel time
reduction of about 14% and 29%, respectively for the two through movements
across the entire test corridor. Through volume sensitivity experiments, the
formulated MA-PPO showed good stability, robustness and adaptability to changes
in traffic demand.</p>

  Reinforcement Learning with Guidance Points</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Motion planning in navigation systems is highly susceptible to upstream
perceptual errors, particularly in human detection and tracking. To mitigate
this issue, the concept of guidance points--a novel directional cue within a
reinforcement learning-based framework--is introduced. A structured method for
identifying guidance points is developed, consisting of obstacle boundary
extraction, potential guidance point detection, and redundancy elimination. To
integrate guidance points into the navigation pipeline, a
perception-to-planning mapping strategy is proposed, unifying guidance points
with other perceptual inputs and enabling the RL agent to effectively leverage
the complementary relationships among raw laser data, human detection and
tracking, and guidance points. Qualitative and quantitative simulations
demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the highest success rate and
near-optimal travel times, greatly improving both safety and efficiency.
Furthermore, real-world experiments in dynamic corridors and lobbies validate
the robot's ability to confidently navigate around obstacles and robustly avoid
pedestrians.</p>
