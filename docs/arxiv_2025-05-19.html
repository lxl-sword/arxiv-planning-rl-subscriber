<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have substantially enhanced machine reasoning across diverse
tasks. However, these models predominantly rely on pure text as the medium for
both expressing and structuring reasoning, even when visual information is
present. In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most
natural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving
spatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new
paradigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual
representations, independent of text. In this paradigm, planning is executed
via sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual
domain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a
novel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement
Learning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models,
leading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of
representative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our
visual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct
reasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a
viable and promising alternative to language-based reasoning, opening new
avenues for tasks that benefit from intuitive, image-based inference.</p>

  Aerial Combat Tactics</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Ardian Selmonaj, Alessandro Antonucci, Adrian Schneider, Michael Rüegsegger, Matthias Sommer</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-16 14:36:30</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping strategic planning, with
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) enabling coordination among
autonomous agents in complex scenarios. However, its practical deployment in
sensitive military contexts is constrained by the lack of explainability, which
is an essential factor for trust, safety, and alignment with human strategies.
This work reviews and assesses current advances in explainability methods for
MARL with a focus on simulated air combat scenarios. We proceed by adapting
various explainability techniques to different aerial combat scenarios to gain
explanatory insights about the model behavior. By linking AI-generated tactics
with human-understandable reasoning, we emphasize the need for transparency to
ensure reliable deployment and meaningful human-machine interaction. By
illuminating the crucial importance of explainability in advancing MARL for
operational defense, our work supports not only strategic planning but also the
training of military personnel with insightful and comprehensible analyses.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-16 05:39:02</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Diffusion models have recently gained prominence in offline reinforcement
learning due to their ability to effectively learn high-performing,
generalizable policies from static datasets. Diffusion-based planners
facilitate long-horizon decision-making by generating high-quality trajectories
through iterative denoising, guided by return-maximizing objectives. However,
existing guided sampling strategies such as Classifier Guidance,
Classifier-Free Guidance, and Monte Carlo Sample Selection either produce
suboptimal multi-modal actions, struggle with distributional drift, or incur
prohibitive inference-time costs. To address these challenges, we propose Prior
Guidance (PG), a novel guided sampling framework that replaces the standard
Gaussian prior of a behavior-cloned diffusion model with a learnable
distribution, optimized via a behavior-regularized objective. PG directly
generates high-value trajectories without costly reward optimization of the
diffusion model itself, and eliminates the need to sample multiple candidates
at inference for sample selection. We present an efficient training strategy
that applies behavior regularization in latent space, and empirically
demonstrate that PG outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies and
planners across diverse long-horizon offline RL benchmarks.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Ashwath Vaithinathan Aravindan, Zhisheng Tang, Mayank Kejriwal</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-15 23:23:31</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We propose an iterative programmatic planning (IPP) framework for solving
grid-based tasks by synthesizing interpretable agent policies expressed in code
using large language models (LLMs). Instead of relying on traditional search or
reinforcement learning, our approach uses code generation as policy synthesis,
where the LLM outputs executable programs that map environment states to action
sequences. Our proposed architecture incorporates several prompting strategies,
including direct code generation, pseudocode-conditioned refinement, and
curriculum-based prompting, but also includes an iterative refinement mechanism
that updates code based on task performance feedback. We evaluate our approach
using six leading LLMs and two challenging grid-based benchmarks (GRASP and
MiniGrid). Our IPP framework demonstrates improvements over direct code
generation ranging from 10\% to as much as 10x across five of the six models
and establishes a new state-of-the-art result for GRASP. IPP is found to
significantly outperform direct elicitation of a solution from GPT-o3-mini (by
63\% on MiniGrid to 116\% on GRASP), demonstrating the viability of the overall
approach. Computational costs of all code generation approaches are similar.
While code generation has a higher initial prompting cost compared to direct
solution elicitation (\$0.08 per task vs. \$0.002 per instance for
GPT-o3-mini), the code can be reused for any number of instances, making the
amortized cost significantly lower (by 400x on GPT-o3-mini across the complete
GRASP benchmark).</p>

  Based on Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Jiaju Qi, Lei Lei, Thorsteinn Jonsson, Lajos Hanzo</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-15 13:13:41</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The charging scheduling problem of Electric Buses (EBs) is investigated based
on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is
conceived, where the time horizon includes multiple charging and operating
periods in a day, while each period is further divided into multiple time
steps. To overcome the challenge of long-range multi-phase planning with sparse
reward, we conceive Hierarchical DRL (HDRL) for decoupling the original MDP
into a high-level Semi-MDP (SMDP) and multiple low-level MDPs. The Hierarchical
Double Deep Q-Network (HDDQN)-Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) algorithm is
proposed for simultaneously solving the decision problems arising at different
temporal resolutions. As a result, the high-level agent learns an effective
policy for prescribing the charging targets for every charging period, while
the low-level agent learns an optimal policy for setting the charging power of
every time step within a single charging period, with the aim of minimizing the
charging costs while meeting the charging target. It is proved that the flat
policy constructed by superimposing the optimal high-level policy and the
optimal low-level policy performs as well as the optimal policy of the original
MDP. Since jointly learning both levels of policies is challenging due to the
non-stationarity of the high-level agent and the sampling inefficiency of the
low-level agent, we divide the joint learning process into two phases and
exploit our new HER algorithm to manipulate the experience replay buffers for
both levels of agents. Numerical experiments are performed with the aid of
real-world data to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, necessitating personalized
treatment approaches to improve outcomes. Theranostics, combining
molecular-level imaging with targeted therapy, offers potential for precision
oncology but requires optimized, patient-specific care plans. This paper
investigates state-of-the-art data-driven decision support applications with a
reinforcement learning focus in precision oncology. We review current
applications, training environments, state-space representation, performance
evaluation criteria, and measurement of risk and reward, highlighting key
challenges. We propose a framework integrating data-driven modeling with
reinforcement learning-based decision support to optimize radiopharmaceutical
therapy dosing, addressing identified challenges and setting directions for
future research. The framework leverages Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
and Physics-Informed Neural Networks to enhance Physiologically Based
Pharmacokinetic models while applying reinforcement learning algorithms to

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-13 22:13:48</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This work presents a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
framework for analyzing simulated air combat scenarios involving heterogeneous
agents. The objective is to identify effective Courses of Action that lead to
mission success within preset simulations, thereby enabling the exploration of
real-world defense scenarios at low cost and in a safe-to-fail setting.
Applying deep Reinforcement Learning in this context poses specific challenges,
such as complex flight dynamics, the exponential size of the state and action
spaces in multi-agent systems, and the capability to integrate real-time
control of individual units with look-ahead planning. To address these
challenges, the decision-making process is split into two levels of
abstraction: low-level policies control individual units, while a high-level
commander policy issues macro commands aligned with the overall mission
targets. This hierarchical structure facilitates the training process by
exploiting policy symmetries of individual agents and by separating control
from command tasks. The low-level policies are trained for individual combat
control in a curriculum of increasing complexity. The high-level commander is
then trained on mission targets given pre-trained control policies. The
empirical validation confirms the advantages of the proposed framework.</p>

  Exploitation</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Shuai Xu, Sijia Cui, Yanna Wang, Bo Xu, Qi Wang</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-13 11:41:10</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Efficiently modeling and exploiting opponents is a long-standing challenge in
adversarial domains. Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive textual
data have recently demonstrated outstanding performance in general tasks,
introducing new research directions for opponent modeling. Some studies
primarily focus on directly using LLMs to generate decisions based on the
elaborate prompt context that incorporates opponent descriptions, while these
approaches are limited to scenarios where LLMs possess adequate domain
expertise. To address that, we introduce a two-stage Strategy-Augmented
Planning (SAP) framework that significantly enhances the opponent exploitation
capabilities of LLM-based agents by utilizing a critical component, the
Strategy Evaluation Network (SEN). Specifically, in the offline stage, we
construct an explicit strategy space and subsequently collect strategy-outcome
pair data for training the SEN network. During the online phase, SAP
dynamically recognizes the opponent's strategies and greedily exploits them by
searching best response strategy on the well-trained SEN, finally translating
strategy to a course of actions by carefully designed prompts. Experimental
results show that SAP exhibits robust generalization capabilities, allowing it
to perform effectively not only against previously encountered opponent
strategies but also against novel, unseen strategies. In the MicroRTS
environment, SAP achieves a 85.35\% performance improvement over baseline
methods and matches the competitiveness of reinforcement learning approaches
against state-of-the-art (SOTA) rule-based AI.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is critical for
applications such as precision agriculture and search and rescue. While
traditional methods rely on discrete grid-based representations, real-world UAV

ensuring complete coverage. Our approach models the environment with
variable-size axis-aligned rectangles and UAV motion with curvature-constrained
B\'ezier curves. We train a reinforcement learning agent using an

  Hierarchical Model-Based Planning</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-13 05:31:32</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Controlling high-dimensional nonlinear systems, such as those found in
biological and robotic applications, is challenging due to large state and
action spaces. While deep reinforcement learning has achieved a number of
successes in these domains, it is computationally intensive and time consuming,
and therefore not suitable for solving large collections of tasks that require
significant manual tuning. In this work, we introduce Model Predictive Control
with Morphology-aware Proportional Control (MPC^2), a hierarchical model-based
learning algorithm for zero-shot and near-real-time control of high-dimensional
complex dynamical systems. MPC^2 uses a sampling-based model predictive
controller for target posture planning, and enables robust control for
high-dimensional tasks by incorporating a morphology-aware proportional
controller for actuator coordination. The algorithm enables motion control of a
high-dimensional human musculoskeletal model in a variety of motion tasks, such
as standing, walking on different terrains, and imitating sports activities.
The reward function of MPC^2 can be tuned via black-box optimization,
drastically reducing the need for human-intensive reward engineering.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-11 09:53:34</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Traditional target tracking pipelines including detection, mapping,
navigation, and control are comprehensive but introduce high latency, limitting
the agility of quadrotors. On the contrary, we follow the design principle of
"less is more", striving to simplify the process while maintaining
effectiveness. In this work, we propose an end-to-end agile tracking and
navigation framework for quadrotors that directly maps the sensory observations
to control commands. Importantly, leveraging the multimodal nature of
navigation and detection tasks, our network maintains interpretability by
explicitly integrating the independent modules of the traditional pipeline,
rather than a crude action regression. In detail, we adopt a set of motion
primitives as anchors to cover the searching space regarding the feasible
region and potential target. Then we reformulate the trajectory optimization as
regression of primitive offsets and associated costs considering the safety,
smoothness, and other metrics. For tracking task, the trajectories are expected
to approach the target and additional objectness scores are predicted.
Subsequently, the predictions, after compensation for the estimated lumped
disturbance, are transformed into thrust and attitude as control commands for
swift response. During training, we seamlessly integrate traditional motion
planning with deep learning by directly back-propagating the gradients of
trajectory costs to the network, eliminating the need for expert demonstration
in imitation learning and providing more direct guidance than reinforcement
learning. Finally, we deploy the algorithm on a compact quadrotor and conduct
real-world validations in both forest and building environments to demonstrate
the efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Larry Preuett III</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-10 05:19:32</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In many real-world planning tasks, agents must tackle uncertainty about the
environment's state and variability in the outcomes of any chosen policy. We
address both forms of uncertainty as a first step toward safer algorithms in
partially observable settings. Specifically, we extend Distributional
Reinforcement Learning (DistRL)-which models the entire return distribution for
fully observable domains-to Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
(POMDPs), allowing an agent to learn the distribution of returns for each
conditional plan. Concretely, we introduce new distributional Bellman operators
for partial observability and prove their convergence under the supremum
p-Wasserstein metric. We also propose a finite representation of these return
distributions via psi-vectors, generalizing the classical alpha-vectors in
POMDP solvers. Building on this, we develop Distributional Point-Based Value
Iteration (DPBVI), which integrates psi-vectors into a standard point-based
backup procedure-bridging DistRL and POMDP planning. By tracking return
distributions, DPBVI naturally enables risk-sensitive control in domains where
rare, high-impact events must be carefully managed. We provide source code to
foster further research in robust decision-making under partial observability.</p>

  and Irregular Plantations</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Weijie Kuang, Hann Woei Ho, Ye Zhou</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-08 06:52:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is vital in precision agriculture to improve
efficiency and resource utilization. In irregular and dispersed plantations,
traditional grid-based CPP often causes redundant coverage over non-vegetated
areas, leading to waste and pollution. To overcome these limitations, we
propose CPP-DIP, a multi-objective CPP framework designed for Micro Air
Vehicles (MAVs). The framework transforms the CPP task into a Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) and optimizes flight paths by minimizing travel
distance, turning angles, and intersection counts. Unlike conventional
approaches, our method does not rely on GPS-based environmental modeling.
Instead, it uses aerial imagery and a Histogram of Oriented Gradients
(HOG)-based approach to detect trees and extract image coordinates. A
density-aware waypoint strategy is applied: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is
used to reduce redundant waypoints in dense regions, while a greedy algorithm
ensures complete coverage in sparse areas. To verify the generality of the
framework, we solve the resulting TSP using three different methods: Greedy
Heuristic Insertion (GHI), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Monte Carlo
Reinforcement Learning (MCRL). Then an object-based optimization is applied to
further refine the resulting path. Additionally, CPP-DIP integrates ForaNav,
our insect-inspired navigation method, for accurate tree localization and
tracking. The experimental results show that MCRL offers a balanced solution,
reducing the travel distance by 16.9 % compared to ACO while maintaining a
similar performance to GHI. It also improves path smoothness by reducing
turning angles by 28.3 % and 59.9 % relative to ACO and GHI, respectively, and
effectively eliminates intersections. These results confirm the robustness and
effectiveness of CPP-DIP in different TSP solvers.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reasoning lies at the heart of intelligence, shaping the ability to make
decisions, draw conclusions, and generalize across domains. In artificial
intelligence, as systems increasingly operate in open, uncertain, and
multimodal environments, reasoning becomes essential for enabling robust and
adaptive behavior. Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) have emerged as a
promising paradigm, integrating modalities such as text, images, audio, and
video to support complex reasoning capabilities and aiming to achieve
comprehensive perception, precise understanding, and deep reasoning. As
research advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular,
perception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer
more coherent cross-modal understanding. While instruction tuning and
reinforcement learning have improved model reasoning, significant challenges
remain in omni-modal generalization, reasoning depth, and agentic behavior. To
address these issues, we present a comprehensive and structured survey of
multimodal reasoning research, organized around a four-stage developmental
roadmap that reflects the field's shifting design philosophies and emerging
capabilities. First, we review early efforts based on task-specific modules,
where reasoning was implicitly embedded across stages of representation,
alignment, and fusion. Next, we examine recent approaches that unify reasoning
into multimodal LLMs, with advances such as Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)
and multimodal reinforcement learning enabling richer and more structured
reasoning chains. Finally, drawing on empirical insights from challenging
benchmarks and experimental cases of OpenAI O3 and O4-mini, we discuss the
conceptual direction of native large multimodal reasoning models (N-LMRMs),
which aim to support scalable, agentic, and adaptive reasoning and planning in
complex, real-world environments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Fast and effective incident response is essential to prevent adversarial
cyberattacks. Autonomous Cyber Defense (ACD) aims to automate incident response
through Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents that plan and execute actions. Most
ACD approaches focus on single-agent scenarios and leverage Reinforcement
Learning (RL). However, ACD RL-trained agents depend on costly training, and
their reasoning is not always explainable or transferable. Large Language
Models (LLMs) can address these concerns by providing explainable actions in
general security contexts. Researchers have explored LLM agents for ACD but
have not evaluated them on multi-agent scenarios or interacting with other ACD
agents. In this paper, we show the first study on how LLMs perform in
multi-agent ACD environments by proposing a new integration to the CybORG CAGE
4 environment. We examine how ACD teams of LLM and RL agents can interact by
proposing a novel communication protocol. Our results highlight the strengths

directions to create, train, and deploy future teams of ACD agents.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Modular self-reconfigurable satellites refer to satellite clusters composed
of individual modular units capable of altering their configurations. The
configuration changes enable the execution of diverse tasks and mission
objectives. Existing path planning algorithms for reconfiguration often suffer
from high computational complexity, poor generalization capability, and limited

  in Vehicular Networks</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based learning approaches for
wireless networks rely on expensive trial-and-error mechanisms and real-time
feedback based on extensive environment interactions, which leads to low data
efficiency and short-sighted policies. These limitations become particularly
problematic in complex, dynamic networks with high uncertainty and long-term
planning requirements. To address these limitations, in this paper, a novel
world model-based learning framework is proposed to minimize
packet-completeness-aware age of information (CAoI) in a vehicular network.
Particularly, a challenging representative scenario is considered pertaining to
a millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network,
which is characterized by high mobility, frequent signal blockages, and
extremely short coherence time. Then, a world model framework is proposed to
jointly learn a dynamic model of the mmWave V2X environment and use it to
imagine trajectories for learning how to perform link scheduling. In
particular, the long-term policy is learned in differentiable imagined
trajectories instead of environment interactions. Moreover, owing to its
imagination abilities, the world model can jointly predict time-varying
wireless data and optimize link scheduling in real-world wireless and V2X
networks. Thus, during intervals without actual observations, the world model
remains capable of making efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are
performed on a realistic simulator based on Sionna that integrates
physics-based end-to-end channel modeling, ray-tracing, and scene geometries
with material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model
achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency, and achieves 26%
improvement and 16% improvement in CAoI, respectively, compared to the
model-based RL (MBRL) method and the model-free RL (MFRL) method.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure safety when an RL agent
conducts learning by interacting with real-world environments where improper
actions can induce high costs or lead to severe consequences. In this paper, we
propose a novel Safe Skill Planning (SSkP) approach to enhance effective safe
RL by exploiting auxiliary offline demonstration data. SSkP involves a
two-stage process. First, we employ PU learning to learn a skill risk predictor
from the offline demonstration data. Then, based on the learned skill risk
predictor, we develop a novel risk planning process to enhance online safe RL
and learn a risk-averse safe policy efficiently through interactions with the
online RL environment, while simultaneously adapting the skill risk predictor
to the environment. We conduct experiments in several benchmark robotic
simulation environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art safe RL methods.</p>

  Explainable Control for Human-Centric Cooperation</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Jaehong Oh</h6>

<p class='card-text'>This is a preprint of a review article that has not yet undergone peer
review. The content is intended for early dissemination and academic
discussion. The final version may differ upon formal publication. As the Fourth
Industrial Revolution reshapes industrial paradigms, human-robot collaboration
(HRC) has transitioned from a desirable capability to an operational necessity.
In response, collaborative robots (Cobots) are evolving beyond repetitive tasks
toward adaptive, semantically informed interaction with humans and
environments. This paper surveys five foundational pillars enabling this
transformation: semantic-level perception, cognitive action planning,
explainable learning and control, safety-aware motion design, and multimodal
human intention recognition. We examine the role of semantic mapping in
transforming spatial data into meaningful context, and explore cognitive
planning frameworks that leverage this context for goal-driven decision-making.
Additionally, we analyze explainable reinforcement learning methods, including
policy distillation and attention mechanisms, which enhance interpretability
and trust. Safety is addressed through force-adaptive control and risk-aware
trajectory planning, while seamless human interaction is supported via gaze and
gesture-based intent recognition. Despite these advancements, challenges such
as perception-action disjunction, real-time explainability limitations, and
incomplete human trust persist. To address these, we propose a unified
Cognitive Synergy Architecture, integrating all modules into a cohesive
framework for truly human-centric cobot collaboration.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Efficient path planning in robotics, particularly within large-scale, dynamic
environments, remains a significant hurdle. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited
adaptability in dynamic scenarios hinder real-time deployment on edge devices.
We present SmallPlan -- a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to
train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning
tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate
across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs
are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not
only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them
aware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with
larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from
hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it
well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous
robotics. Our source code is available here:
