<p class='card-text'>Autonomous navigation in intelligent mobile systems represents a core
research focus within artificial intelligence-driven robotics. Contemporary
path planning approaches face constraints in dynamic environmental
responsiveness and multi-objective task scalability, limiting their capacity to
address growing intelligent operation requirements. Decision-centric
reinforcement learning frameworks, capitalizing on their unique strengths in
adaptive environmental interaction and self-optimization, have gained
prominence in advanced control system research. This investigation introduces
methodological improvements to address sample homogeneity challenges in
reinforcement learning experience replay mechanisms. By incorporating
determinant point processes (DPP) for diversity assessment, we develop a
dual-criteria sampling framework with adaptive selection protocols. This
approach resolves representation bias in conventional prioritized experience
replay (PER) systems while preserving algorithmic interoperability, offering
improved decision optimization for dynamic operational scenarios. Key
contributions comprise: Develop a hybrid sampling paradigm (PER-DPP) combining
priority sequencing with diversity maximization.Based on this,create an
integrated optimization scheme (PER-DPP-Elastic DQN) merging diversity-aware
sampling with adaptive step-size regulation. Comparative simulations in 2D
navigation scenarios demonstrate that the elastic step-size component
temporarily delays initial convergence speed but synergistically enhances
final-stage optimization with PER-DPP integration. The synthesized method
generates navigation paths with optimized length efficiency and directional
stability.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-10 07:05:07</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Building predictive models for tabular data presents fundamental challenges,
notably in scaling consistently, i.e., more resources translating to better
performance, and generalizing systematically beyond the training data
distribution. Designing decision tree models remains especially challenging
given the intractably large search space, and most existing methods rely on
greedy heuristics, while deep learning inductive biases expect a temporal or
spatial structure not naturally present in tabular data. We propose a hybrid
amortized structure inference approach to learn predictive decision tree
ensembles given data, formulating decision tree construction as a sequential
planning problem. We train a deep reinforcement learning (GFlowNet) policy to
solve this problem, yielding a generative model that samples decision trees
from the Bayesian posterior. We show that our approach, DT-GFN, outperforms
state-of-the-art decision tree and deep learning methods on standard
classification benchmarks derived from real-world data, robustness to
distribution shifts, and anomaly detection, all while yielding interpretable
models with shorter description lengths. Samples from the trained DT-GFN model
can be ensembled to construct a random forest, and we further show that the
performance of scales consistently in ensemble size, yielding ensembles of
predictors that continue to generalize systematically.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The capture of flying MAVs (micro aerial vehicles) has garnered increasing
research attention due to its intriguing challenges and promising applications.
Despite recent advancements, a key limitation of existing work is that capture
strategies are often relatively simple and constrained by platform performance.
This paper addresses control strategies capable of capturing
high-maneuverability targets. The unique challenge of achieving target capture
under unstable conditions distinguishes this task from traditional
pursuit-evasion and guidance problems. In this study, we transition from larger
MAV platforms to a specially designed, compact capture MAV equipped with a
custom launching device while maintaining high maneuverability. We explore both
time-optimal planning (TOP) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods.
Simulations demonstrate that TOP offers highly maneuverable and shorter
trajectories, while RL excels in real-time adaptability and stability.
Moreover, the RL method has been tested in real-world scenarios, successfully
achieving target capture even in unstable states.</p>

  Generative Flow Networks</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Haoqiang Kang, Enna Sachdeva, Piyush Gupta, Sangjae Bae, Kwonjoon Lee</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-09 08:38:10</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promising advancements in
sequential decision-making tasks through task-specific fine-tuning. However,
common fine-tuning methods, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO),
present notable limitations: SFT assumes Independent and Identically
Distributed (IID) data, while PPO focuses on maximizing cumulative rewards.
These limitations often restrict solution diversity and hinder generalization
in multi-step reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce a
novel framework, GFlowVLM, a framework that fine-tune VLMs using Generative
Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to promote generation of diverse solutions for
complex reasoning tasks. GFlowVLM models the environment as a non-Markovian
decision process, allowing it to capture long-term dependencies essential for
real-world applications. It takes observations and task descriptions as inputs
to prompt chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning which subsequently guides action
selection. We use task based rewards to fine-tune VLM with GFlowNets. This
approach enables VLMs to outperform prior fine-tuning methods, including SFT
and RL. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of GFlowVLM on complex
tasks such as card games (NumberLine, BlackJack) and embodied planning tasks
(ALFWorld), showing enhanced training efficiency, solution diversity, and
stronger generalization capabilities across both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution scenarios.</p>

  Sequential Experimental Design</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Yasir Zubayr Barlas, Kizito Salako</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-07 19:57:39</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Recent developments in sequential experimental design look to construct a
policy that can efficiently navigate the design space, in a way that maximises
the expected information gain. Whilst there is work on achieving tractable
policies for experimental design problems, there is significantly less work on
obtaining policies that are able to generalise well - i.e. able to give good
performance despite a change in the underlying statistical properties of the
experiments. Conducting experiments sequentially has recently brought about the
use of reinforcement learning, where an agent is trained to navigate the design
space to select the most informative designs for experimentation. However,
there is still a lack of understanding about the benefits and drawbacks of
using certain reinforcement learning algorithms to train these agents. In our
work, we investigate several reinforcement learning algorithms and their
efficacy in producing agents that take maximally informative design decisions
in sequential experimental design scenarios. We find that agent performance is
impacted depending on the algorithm used for training, and that particular
algorithms, using dropout or ensemble approaches, empirically showcase
attractive generalisation properties.</p>

  Problem under Stochastic Supply and Demand</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Umur Hasturk, Albert H. Schrotenboer, Kees Jan Roodbergen, Evrim Ursavas</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Green hydrogen has multiple use cases and is produced from renewable energy,
such as solar or wind energy. It can be stored in large quantities, decoupling
renewable energy generation from its use, and is therefore considered essential
for achieving a climate-neutral economy. The intermittency of renewable energy
generation and the stochastic nature of demand are, however, challenging
factors for the dynamic planning of hydrogen storage and transportation. This
holds particularly in the early-adoption phase when hydrogen distribution
occurs through vehicle-based networks. We therefore address the Dynamic
Inventory Routing Problem (DIRP) under stochastic supply and demand with direct
deliveries for the vehicle-based distribution of hydrogen. To solve this
problem, we propose a Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework that
integrates constraints into the learning process and incorporates parameterized
post-decision state value predictions. Additionally, we introduce
Lookahead-based CRL (LCRL), which improves decision-making over a multi-period
horizon to enhance short-term planning while maintaining the value predictions.
Our computational experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CRL and LCRL across
diverse instances. Our learning methods provide near-optimal solutions on small
scale instances that are solved via value iteration. Furthermore, both methods
outperform typical deep learning approaches such as Proximal Policy
Optimization, as well as classical inventory heuristics, such as
(s,S)-policy-based and Power-of-Two-based heuristics. Furthermore, LCRL
achieves a 10% improvement over CRL on average, albeit with higher
computational requirements. Analyses of optimal replenishment policies reveal
that accounting for stochastic supply and demand influences these policies,
showing the importance of our addition to the DIRP.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language
Models (VLMs) have significantly impacted robotics, enabling high-level
semantic motion planning applications. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
complementary paradigm, enables agents to autonomously optimize complex
behaviors through interaction and reward signals. However, designing effective
reward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks
where sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate
design. In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex
HumanInformed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4,
a pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language
task descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated
environments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance
feasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria,
creating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable
text into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive
simulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an
ABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness.
Tasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We offer a new in-depth investigation of global path planning (GPP) for
unmanned ground vehicles, an autonomous mining sampling robot named ROMIE. GPP
is essential for ROMIE's optimal performance, which is translated into solving
the traveling salesman problem, a complex graph theory challenge that is
crucial for determining the most effective route to cover all sampling
locations in a mining field. This problem is central to enhancing ROMIE's
operational efficiency and competitiveness against human labor by optimizing
cost and time. The primary aim of this research is to advance GPP by
developing, evaluating, and improving a cost-efficient software and web
application. We delve into an extensive comparison and analysis of Google
operations research (OR)-Tools optimization algorithms. Our study is driven by
the goal of applying and testing the limits of OR-Tools capabilities by
integrating Reinforcement Learning techniques for the first time. This enables
us to compare these methods with OR-Tools, assessing their computational
effectiveness and real-world application efficiency. Our analysis seeks to

  Navigation in Narrow Environment</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-05 05:53:08</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Autonomous navigation is a fundamental task for robot vacuum cleaners in
indoor environments. Since their core function is to clean entire areas, robots
inevitably encounter dead zones in cluttered and narrow scenarios. Existing
planning methods often fail to escape due to complex environmental constraints,
high-dimensional search spaces, and high difficulty maneuvers. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes an embodied escaping model that leverages
reinforcement learning-based policy with an efficient action mask for dead zone
escaping. To alleviate the issue of the sparse reward in training, we introduce
a hybrid training policy that improves learning efficiency. In handling
redundant and ineffective action options, we design a novel action
representation to reshape the discrete action space with a uniform turning
radius. Furthermore, we develop an action mask strategy to select valid action
quickly, balancing precision and efficiency. In real-world experiments, our
robot is equipped with a Lidar, IMU, and two-wheel encoders. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments across varying difficulty levels
demonstrate that our robot can consistently escape from challenging dead zones.
Moreover, our approach significantly outperforms compared path planning and
reinforcement learning methods in terms of success rate and collision
avoidance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Efficient path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is crucial in
remote sensing and information collection. As task scales expand, the
cooperative deployment of multiple UAVs significantly improves information
collection efficiency. However, collaborative communication and decision-making
for multiple UAVs remain major challenges in path planning, especially in noisy
environments. To efficiently accomplish complex information collection tasks in
3D space and address robust communication issues, we propose a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for UAV path planning based on the
Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients (COMA) algorithm. The framework
incorporates attention mechanism-based UAV communication protocol and
training-deployment system, significantly improving communication robustness
and individual decision-making capabilities in noisy conditions. Experiments
conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method

  Agricultural Vehicle Routing Optimization</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Yixuan Fan, Haotian Xu, Mengqiao Liu, Qing Zhuo, Tao Zhang</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-04 07:50:32</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The Entrance Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem (EDVRP) is a variant of the
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) where the scale of cities influences routing
outcomes, necessitating consideration of their entrances. This paper addresses
EDVRP in agriculture, focusing on multi-parameter vehicle planning for
irregularly shaped fields. To address the limitations of traditional methods,
such as heuristic approaches, which often overlook field geometry and entrance
constraints, we propose a Joint Probability Distribution Sampling Neural
Network (JPDS-NN) to effectively solve the EDVRP. The network uses an
encoder-decoder architecture with graph transformers and attention mechanisms
to model routing as a Markov Decision Process, and is trained via reinforcement
learning for efficient and rapid end-to-end planning. Experimental results
indicate that JPDS-NN reduces travel distances by 48.4-65.4%, lowers fuel
consumption by 14.0-17.6%, and computes two orders of magnitude faster than
baseline methods, while demonstrating 15-25% superior performance in dynamic
arrangement scenarios. Ablation studies validate the necessity of
cross-attention and pre-training. The framework enables scalable, intelligent

  Learning. Case Study on a simulated real-world corridor</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Dickness Kakitahi Kwesiga, Angshuman Guin, Michael Hunter</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-04 01:54:44</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The very few studies that have attempted to formulate multi-agent
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control have
mainly used value-based RL methods although recent literature has shown that
policy-based methods may perform better in partially observable environments.
Additionally, because of the simplifying assumptions on signal timing made
almost universally across previous studies, RL methods remain largely untested
for real-world signal timing plans. This study formulates a multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO) algorithm to implement adaptive and
coordinated traffic control along an arterial corridor. The formulated MA-PPO
has centralized critic architecture under the centralized training and
decentralized execution framework. All agents are formulated to allow selection
and implementation of up to eight signal phases as commonly implemented in the
field controllers. The formulated algorithm is tested on a simulated real-world
corridor with seven intersections, actual/complete traffic movements and signal
phases, traffic volumes, and network geometry including intersection spacings.
The performance of the formulated MA-PPO adaptive control algorithm is compared
with the field implemented coordinated and actuated signal control (ASC) plans
modeled using Vissim-MaxTime software in the loop simulation (SILs). The speed
of convergence for each agent largely depended on the size of the action space
which in turn depended on the number and sequence of signal phases. Compared
with the currently implemented ASC signal timings, MA-PPO showed a travel time
reduction of about 14% and 29%, respectively for the two through movements
across the entire test corridor. Through volume sensitivity experiments, the
formulated MA-PPO showed good stability, robustness and adaptability to changes
in traffic demand.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-03 22:53:06</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Motion planning in navigation systems is highly susceptible to upstream
perceptual errors, particularly in human detection and tracking. To mitigate
this issue, the concept of guidance points--a novel directional cue within a
reinforcement learning-based framework--is introduced. A structured method for
identifying guidance points is developed, consisting of obstacle boundary
extraction, potential guidance point detection, and redundancy elimination. To
integrate guidance points into the navigation pipeline, a
perception-to-planning mapping strategy is proposed, unifying guidance points
with other perceptual inputs and enabling the RL agent to effectively leverage
the complementary relationships among raw laser data, human detection and
tracking, and guidance points. Qualitative and quantitative simulations
demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the highest success rate and
near-optimal travel times, greatly improving both safety and efficiency.
Furthermore, real-world experiments in dynamic corridors and lobbies validate

<p class='card-text'>Path planning for robotic exploration is challenging, requiring reasoning
over unknown spaces and anticipating future observations. Efficient exploration
requires selecting budget-constrained paths that maximize information gain.
Despite advances in autonomous exploration, existing algorithms still fall
short of human performance, particularly in structured environments where
predictive cues exist but are underutilized. Guided by insights from our user
study, we introduce MapExRL, which improves robot exploration efficiency in
structured indoor environments by enabling longer-horizon planning through
reinforcement learning (RL) and global map predictions. Unlike many RL-based
exploration methods that use motion primitives as the action space, our
approach leverages frontiers for more efficient model learning and longer
horizon reasoning. Our framework generates global map predictions from the
observed map, which our policy utilizes, along with the prediction uncertainty,
estimated sensor coverage, frontier distance, and remaining distance budget, to
assess the strategic long-term value of frontiers. By leveraging multiple
frontier scoring methods and additional context, our policy makes more informed
decisions at each stage of the exploration. We evaluate our framework on a
real-world indoor map dataset, achieving up to an 18.8% improvement over the
strongest state-of-the-art baseline, with even greater gains compared to
conventional frontier-based algorithms.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In recent research advancements within the community, large language models
(LLMs) have sparked great interest in creating autonomous agents. However,
current prompt-based agents often heavily rely on large-scale LLMs. Meanwhile,
although fine-tuning methods significantly enhance the capabilities of smaller
LLMs, the fine-tuned agents often lack the potential for self-reflection and
self-improvement. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel agent
framework named RetroAct, which is a framework that jointly optimizes both
task-planning and self-reflective evolution capabilities in language agents.
Specifically, we develop a two-stage joint optimization process that integrates
imitation learning and reinforcement learning, and design an off-policy joint
policy gradient optimization algorithm with imitation learning regularization
to enhance the data efficiency and training stability in agent tasks. RetroAct
significantly improves the performance of open-source models, reduces

spaces, such as DreamerV3, have demonstrated strong performance in discrete
action settings and visual control tasks, their comparative performance in
state-based continuous control remains underexplored. In contrast, methods with
continuous latent spaces, such as TD-MPC2, have shown notable success in
state-based continuous control benchmarks. In this paper, we demonstrate that
modeling discrete latent states has benefits over continuous latent states and
that discrete codebook encodings are more effective representations for
continuous control, compared to alternative encodings, such as one-hot and
label-based encodings. Based on these insights, we introduce DCWM: Discrete
Codebook World Model, a self-supervised world model with a discrete and
stochastic latent space, where latent states are codes from a codebook. We
combine DCWM with decision-time planning to get our model-based RL algorithm,
named DC-MPC: Discrete Codebook Model Predictive Control, which performs
competitively against recent state-of-the-art algorithms, including TD-MPC2 and
DreamerV3, on continuous control benchmarks. See our project website

  bandits</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) has increasingly been applied to solve real-world
planning problems, with progress in handling large state spaces and time
horizons. However, a key bottleneck in many domains is that RL methods cannot
accommodate large, combinatorially structured action spaces. In such settings,
even representing the set of feasible actions at a single step may require a
complex discrete optimization formulation. We leverage recent advances in
embedding trained neural networks into optimization problems to propose
SEQUOIA, an RL algorithm that directly optimizes for long-term reward over the
feasible action space. Our approach embeds a Q-network into a mixed-integer
program to select a combinatorial action in each timestep. Here, we focus on
planning over restless bandits, a class of planning problems which capture many
real-world examples of sequential decision making. We introduce coRMAB, a
broader class of restless bandits with combinatorial actions that cannot be
decoupled across the arms of the restless bandit, requiring direct solving over
the joint, exponentially large action space. We empirically validate SEQUOIA on
four novel restless bandit problems with combinatorial constraints: multiple
interventions, path constraints, bipartite matching, and capacity constraints.
Our approach significantly outperforms existing methods -- which cannot address
sequential planning and combinatorial selection simultaneously -- by an average
of 26.4% on these difficult instances.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Haofei Lu, Dongqi Han, Yifei Shen, Dongsheng Li</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Diffusion models have recently shown significant potential in solving
decision-making problems, particularly in generating behavior plans -- also
known as diffusion planning. While numerous studies have demonstrated the
impressive performance of diffusion planning, the mechanisms behind the key
components of a good diffusion planner remain unclear and the design choices
are highly inconsistent in existing studies. In this work, we address this
issue through systematic empirical experiments on diffusion planning in an
offline reinforcement learning (RL) setting, providing practical insights into
the essential components of diffusion planning. We trained and evaluated over
6,000 diffusion models, identifying the critical components such as guided
sampling, network architecture, action generation and planning strategy. We
revealed that some design choices opposite to the common practice in previous
work in diffusion planning actually lead to better performance, e.g.,
unconditional sampling with selection can be better than guided sampling and
Transformer outperforms U-Net as denoising network. Based on these insights, we
suggest a simple yet strong diffusion planning baseline that achieves
state-of-the-art results on standard offline RL benchmarks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have created
models capable of high-quality musical content generation. However, little
consideration is given to how to use these models for real-time or cooperative
jamming musical applications because of crucial required features: low latency,
the ability to communicate planned actions, and the ability to adapt to user
input in real-time. To support these needs, we introduce ReaLJam, an interface
and protocol for live musical jamming sessions between a human and a
Transformer-based AI agent trained with reinforcement learning. We enable
real-time interactions using the concept of anticipation, where the agent
continually predicts how the performance will unfold and visually conveys its
plan to the user. We conduct a user study where experienced musicians jam in
real-time with the agent through ReaLJam. Our results demonstrate that ReaLJam
enables enjoyable and musically interesting sessions, and we uncover important
takeaways for future work.</p>
