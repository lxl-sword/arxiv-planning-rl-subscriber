  Planning</a></h2>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Gordon, Dieter Fox, Ali Farhadi</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Long-term planning poses a major difficulty to many reinforcement learning
algorithms. This problem becomes even more pronounced in dynamic visual
environments. In this work we propose Hierarchical Planning and Reinforcement
Learning (HIP-RL), a method for merging the benefits and capabilities of
Symbolic Planning with the learning abilities of Deep Reinforcement Learning.
We apply HIPRL to the complex visual tasks of interactive question answering
and visual semantic planning and achieve state-...</p>

  Prediction in Reinforcement Learning</a></h2>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyunwoo Park</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional trajectory planning methods for autonomous vehicles have several
limitations. For example, heuristic and explicit simple rules limit
generalizability and hinder complex motions. These limitations can be addressed
using reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning. However, reinforcement
learning suffers from unstable learning, and existing reinforcement
learning-based trajectory planning methods do not consider the uncertainties.
Thus, this paper, proposes a reinforcement learnin...</p>

  Learning for Robust Decision-Making</a></h2>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fangkai Yang, Daoming Lyu, Bo Liu, Steven Gustafson</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement learning and symbolic planning have both been used to build
intelligent autonomous agents. Reinforcement learning relies on learning from
interactions with real world, which often requires an unfeasibly large amount
of experience. Symbolic planning relies on manually crafted symbolic knowledge,
which may not be robust to domain uncertainties and changes. In this paper we
present a unified framework {\em PEORL} that integrates symbolic planning with
hierarchical reinforcement learni...</p>

  reinforcement learning for robotic causal problem-solving</a></h2>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manfred Eppe, Phuong D. H. Nguyen, Stefan Wermter</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement learning is an appropriate and successful method to robustly
perform low-level robot control under noisy conditions. Symbolic action
planning is useful to resolve causal dependencies and to break a causally
complex problem down into a sequence of simpler high-level actions. A problem
with the integration of both approaches is that action planning is based on
discrete high-level action- and state spaces, whereas reinforcement learning is
usually driven by a continuous reward functio...</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents a novel motion and trajectory planning algorithm for
nonholonomic mobile robots that uses recent advances in deep reinforcement
learning. Starting from a random initial state, i.e., position, velocity and
orientation, the robot reaches an arbitrary target state while taking both

<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akanksha Gupta, Jaya Kumar Alageshan, Kolluru Venkata Kiran, Rahul Pandit</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We show that flocking of microswimmers in a turbulent flow can enhance the
efficacy of reinforcement-learning-based path-planning of microswimmers in
turbulent flows. In particular, we develop a machine-learning strategy that
incorporates Vicsek-model-type flocking in microswimmer assemblies in a

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement learning has shown great potential in generalizing over raw
sensory data using only a single neural network for value optimization. There
are several challenges in the current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
algorithms that prevent them from converging towards the global optima. It is
likely that the solution to these problems lies in short- and long-term

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Despite remarkable successes, deep reinforcement learning algorithms remain
sample inefficient: they require an enormous amount of trial and error to find
good policies. Model-based algorithms promise sample efficiency by building an
environment model that can be used for planning. Posterior Sampling for
Reinforcement Learning is such a model-based algorithm that has attracted
significant interest due to its performance in the tabular setting. This paper

<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuerun Chen</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> In agent control issues, the idea of combining reinforcement learning and
planning has attracted much attention. Two methods focus on micro and macro
action respectively. Their advantages would show together if there is a good
cooperation between them. An essential for the cooperation is to find an
appropriate boundary, assigning different functions to each method. Such

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Sequential decision making, commonly formalized as optimization of a Markov
Decision Process, is a key challenge in artificial intelligence. Two successful
approaches to MDP optimization are reinforcement learning and planning, which
both largely have their own research communities. However, if both research
fields solve the same problem, then we might be able to disentangle the common

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> In the world of advice and financial planning, there is seldom one right
answer. While traditional algorithms have been successful in solving linear
problems, its success often depends on choosing the right features from a

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning has generated significant
interest in the AI community as it provides an elegant solution to the optimal
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in classical reinforcement learning.
Unfortunately, the applicability of this type of approach has been limited to
small domains due to the high complexity of reasoning about the joint posterior

settings. In our work, the knowledge in state-of-art planning methods is reused
by single-step options whose action suggestions are compared in parallel with

kind of trial-and-error learning can be impractical or inefficient in complex
environments. The use of demonstrations, on the other hand, enables agents to
benefit from expert knowledge rather than having to discover the best action to

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Despite advances in hierarchical reinforcement learning, its applications to
path planning in autonomous driving on highways are challenging. One reason is
that conventional hierarchical reinforcement learning approaches are not
amenable to autonomous driving due to its riskiness: the agent must move

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A promising way to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning is
model-based methods, in which many explorations and evaluations can happen in
the learned models to save real-world samples. However, when the learned model

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> This paper investigates a new approach to model-based reinforcement learning
using background planning: mixing (approximate) dynamic programming updates and
model-free updates, similar to the Dyna architecture. Background planning with

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A large part of the interest in model-based reinforcement learning derives
from the potential utility to acquire a forward model capable of strategic long
term decision making. Assuming that an agent succeeds in learning a useful

Planning deals with finding such principles for a class of planning problems,

structure in several ways: (i) We simplify the search over plans by leveraging
knowledge of skill objectives, (ii) Shorter plans are generated by enforcing
aggressively hierarchical planning, (iii) We learn transition dynamics with
sparse local models for better generalisation. Our framework decomposes
transition dynamics into skill effects and succes...</p>

<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christos Dimitrakakis</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> There has been a lot of recent work on Bayesian methods for reinforcement
learning exhibiting near-optimal online performance. The main obstacle facing
such methods is that in most problems of interest, the optimal solution
involves planning in an infinitely large tree. However, it is possible to
obtain stochastic lower and upper bounds on the value of each tree node. This

constraints in task and motion planning, aiming to find a plan that can be
executed within the deadline despite uncertain planning and execution times. We
propose an effort allocation problem, formulated as a Markov decision process
(MDP), to find such a plan by leveraging metareasoning perspectives to allocate

catastrophically. Planning involves composing the predictions of the model;
when flawed predictions are composed, even minor errors can compound and render
the model useless for planning. Hallucinated Replay (Talvitie 2014) trains the

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Specifying a Reinforcement Learning (RL) task involves choosing a suitable
planning horizon, which is typically modeled by a discount factor. It is known
that applying RL algorithms with a lower discount factor can act as a
regularizer, improving performance in the limited data regime. Yet the exact
nature of this regularizer has not been investigated. In this work, we fill in
this gap. For several Temporal-Difference (TD) learning methods, we show an

Recent works provide a novel perspective by viewing offline RL as a generic

a suitable concept to formalize such traffic rules. Still, temporal logic rules
often result in constraints that are hard to solve using optimization-based
motion planners. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising method to find
motion plans for autonomous vehicles. However, vanilla RL algorithms are based

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Planning plays an important role in the broad class of decision theory.
Planning has drawn much attention in recent work in the robotics and sequential
decision making areas. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL), as an
agent-environment interaction problem, has brought further attention to
planning methods. Generally in RL, one can assume a generative model, e.g.
graphical models, for the environment, and then the task for the RL agent is to

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Decision making in multi-agent systems (MAS) is a great challenge due to
enormous state and joint action spaces as well as uncertainty, making
centralized control generally infeasible. Decentralized control offers better
scalability and robustness but requires mechanisms to coordinate on joint tasks

challenges in reinforcement learning. Temporal Abstraction have somewhat made
this possible, but efficiently planing using temporal abstraction still remains
an issue. Moreover using spatial abstractions to learn policies for various
situations at once while using temporal abstraction models is an open problem.

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (RL) architecture,

unreliability, and frequent handoffs in the airspace are the main obstacles to
unleash its full potential. Given that existing cellular networks were
primarily designed to service ground users, re-utilizing the same architecture
for highly mobile aerial users, e.g., cargo-UAVs, is deemed challenging.
Indeed, to ensure a safe delivery using cargo-UAVs, it ...</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for

deviate slightly or when composed hierarchically to solve even more complex

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Well-established optimization-based methods can guarantee an optimal

<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vasilii Davydov, Alexey Skrynnik, Konstantin Yakovlev, Aleksandr I. Panov</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we consider the problem of multi-agent navigation in partially
observable grid environments. This problem is challenging for centralized
planning approaches as they, typically, rely on the full knowledge of the

follow these policies to reach their goals. To tackle the challenge associated

<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evan Zheran Liu, Ramtin Keramati, Sudarshan Seshadri, Kelvin Guu, Panupong Pasupat, Emma Brunskill, Percy Liang</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing because (i) it enables
planning and thus more strategic exploration, and (ii) by decoupling dynamics
from rewards, it enables fast transfer to new reward functions. However,
learning an accurate Markov Decision Process (MDP) over high-dimensional states
(e.g., raw pixels) is extremely challenging because it requires function
approximation, which leads to compounding errors. Instead, to avoid compounding
errors, we propose learning an abstract ...</p>

of multiple temporally extended sub-tasks. Due to the sub-task

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a classic tool for optimal control of
complex, real-world systems. Although it has been successfully applied to a
wide range of challenging tasks in robotics, it is fundamentally limited by the
prediction horizon, which, if too short, will result in myopic decisions.
Recently, several papers have suggested using a learned value function as the

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous driving in multi-agent dynamic traffic scenarios is challenging:
the behaviors of road users are uncertain and are hard to model explicitly, and
the ego-vehicle should apply complicated negotiation skills with them, such as
