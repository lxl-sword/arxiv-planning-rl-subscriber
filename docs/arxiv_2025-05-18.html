  Based on Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Jiaju Qi, Lei Lei, Thorsteinn Jonsson, Lajos Hanzo</h6>

<p class='card-text'>The charging scheduling problem of Electric Buses (EBs) is investigated based
on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is
conceived, where the time horizon includes multiple charging and operating
periods in a day, while each period is further divided into multiple time
steps. To overcome the challenge of long-range multi-phase planning with sparse
reward, we conceive Hierarchical DRL (HDRL) for decoupling the original MDP
into a high-level Semi-MDP (SMDP) and multiple low-level MDPs. The Hierarchical
Double Deep Q-Network (HDDQN)-Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) algorithm is
proposed for simultaneously solving the decision problems arising at different
temporal resolutions. As a result, the high-level agent learns an effective
policy for prescribing the charging targets for every charging period, while
the low-level agent learns an optimal policy for setting the charging power of
every time step within a single charging period, with the aim of minimizing the
charging costs while meeting the charging target. It is proved that the flat
policy constructed by superimposing the optimal high-level policy and the
optimal low-level policy performs as well as the optimal policy of the original
MDP. Since jointly learning both levels of policies is challenging due to the
non-stationarity of the high-level agent and the sampling inefficiency of the
low-level agent, we divide the joint learning process into two phases and
exploit our new HER algorithm to manipulate the experience replay buffers for
both levels of agents. Numerical experiments are performed with the aid of
real-world data to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, necessitating personalized
treatment approaches to improve outcomes. Theranostics, combining
molecular-level imaging with targeted therapy, offers potential for precision
oncology but requires optimized, patient-specific care plans. This paper
investigates state-of-the-art data-driven decision support applications with a
reinforcement learning focus in precision oncology. We review current
applications, training environments, state-space representation, performance
evaluation criteria, and measurement of risk and reward, highlighting key
challenges. We propose a framework integrating data-driven modeling with
reinforcement learning-based decision support to optimize radiopharmaceutical
therapy dosing, addressing identified challenges and setting directions for
future research. The framework leverages Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
and Physics-Informed Neural Networks to enhance Physiologically Based
Pharmacokinetic models while applying reinforcement learning algorithms to

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-13 22:13:48</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This work presents a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
framework for analyzing simulated air combat scenarios involving heterogeneous
agents. The objective is to identify effective Courses of Action that lead to
mission success within preset simulations, thereby enabling the exploration of
real-world defense scenarios at low cost and in a safe-to-fail setting.
Applying deep Reinforcement Learning in this context poses specific challenges,
such as complex flight dynamics, the exponential size of the state and action
spaces in multi-agent systems, and the capability to integrate real-time
control of individual units with look-ahead planning. To address these
challenges, the decision-making process is split into two levels of
abstraction: low-level policies control individual units, while a high-level
commander policy issues macro commands aligned with the overall mission
targets. This hierarchical structure facilitates the training process by
exploiting policy symmetries of individual agents and by separating control
from command tasks. The low-level policies are trained for individual combat
control in a curriculum of increasing complexity. The high-level commander is
then trained on mission targets given pre-trained control policies. The
empirical validation confirms the advantages of the proposed framework.</p>

  Exploitation</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Shuai Xu, Sijia Cui, Yanna Wang, Bo Xu, Qi Wang</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-13 11:41:10</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Efficiently modeling and exploiting opponents is a long-standing challenge in
adversarial domains. Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive textual
data have recently demonstrated outstanding performance in general tasks,
introducing new research directions for opponent modeling. Some studies
primarily focus on directly using LLMs to generate decisions based on the
elaborate prompt context that incorporates opponent descriptions, while these
approaches are limited to scenarios where LLMs possess adequate domain
expertise. To address that, we introduce a two-stage Strategy-Augmented
Planning (SAP) framework that significantly enhances the opponent exploitation
capabilities of LLM-based agents by utilizing a critical component, the
Strategy Evaluation Network (SEN). Specifically, in the offline stage, we
construct an explicit strategy space and subsequently collect strategy-outcome
pair data for training the SEN network. During the online phase, SAP
dynamically recognizes the opponent's strategies and greedily exploits them by
searching best response strategy on the well-trained SEN, finally translating
strategy to a course of actions by carefully designed prompts. Experimental
results show that SAP exhibits robust generalization capabilities, allowing it
to perform effectively not only against previously encountered opponent
strategies but also against novel, unseen strategies. In the MicroRTS
environment, SAP achieves a 85.35\% performance improvement over baseline
methods and matches the competitiveness of reinforcement learning approaches
against state-of-the-art (SOTA) rule-based AI.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is critical for
applications such as precision agriculture and search and rescue. While
traditional methods rely on discrete grid-based representations, real-world UAV
operations require power-efficient continuous motion planning. We formulate the
UAV CPP problem in a continuous environment, minimizing power consumption while
ensuring complete coverage. Our approach models the environment with
variable-size axis-aligned rectangles and UAV motion with curvature-constrained
B\'ezier curves. We train a reinforcement learning agent using an
action-mapping-based Soft Actor-Critic (AM-SAC) algorithm employing a
self-adaptive curriculum. Experiments on both procedurally generated and
hand-crafted scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in learning
energy-efficient coverage strategies.</p>

  Hierarchical Model-Based Planning</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-13 05:31:32</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Controlling high-dimensional nonlinear systems, such as those found in
biological and robotic applications, is challenging due to large state and
action spaces. While deep reinforcement learning has achieved a number of
successes in these domains, it is computationally intensive and time consuming,
and therefore not suitable for solving large collections of tasks that require
significant manual tuning. In this work, we introduce Model Predictive Control
with Morphology-aware Proportional Control (MPC^2), a hierarchical model-based
learning algorithm for zero-shot and near-real-time control of high-dimensional
complex dynamical systems. MPC^2 uses a sampling-based model predictive
controller for target posture planning, and enables robust control for
high-dimensional tasks by incorporating a morphology-aware proportional
controller for actuator coordination. The algorithm enables motion control of a
high-dimensional human musculoskeletal model in a variety of motion tasks, such
as standing, walking on different terrains, and imitating sports activities.
The reward function of MPC^2 can be tuned via black-box optimization,
drastically reducing the need for human-intensive reward engineering.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-11 09:53:34</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Traditional target tracking pipelines including detection, mapping,
navigation, and control are comprehensive but introduce high latency, limitting
the agility of quadrotors. On the contrary, we follow the design principle of
"less is more", striving to simplify the process while maintaining
effectiveness. In this work, we propose an end-to-end agile tracking and
navigation framework for quadrotors that directly maps the sensory observations
to control commands. Importantly, leveraging the multimodal nature of
navigation and detection tasks, our network maintains interpretability by
explicitly integrating the independent modules of the traditional pipeline,
rather than a crude action regression. In detail, we adopt a set of motion
primitives as anchors to cover the searching space regarding the feasible
region and potential target. Then we reformulate the trajectory optimization as
regression of primitive offsets and associated costs considering the safety,
smoothness, and other metrics. For tracking task, the trajectories are expected
to approach the target and additional objectness scores are predicted.
Subsequently, the predictions, after compensation for the estimated lumped
disturbance, are transformed into thrust and attitude as control commands for
swift response. During training, we seamlessly integrate traditional motion
planning with deep learning by directly back-propagating the gradients of
trajectory costs to the network, eliminating the need for expert demonstration
in imitation learning and providing more direct guidance than reinforcement
learning. Finally, we deploy the algorithm on a compact quadrotor and conduct
real-world validations in both forest and building environments to demonstrate
the efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

  Partially Observable Domains</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Larry Preuett III</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-10 05:19:32</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In many real-world planning tasks, agents must tackle uncertainty about the
environment's state and variability in the outcomes of any chosen policy. We
address both forms of uncertainty as a first step toward safer algorithms in
partially observable settings. Specifically, we extend Distributional
Reinforcement Learning (DistRL)-which models the entire return distribution for
fully observable domains-to Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
(POMDPs), allowing an agent to learn the distribution of returns for each
conditional plan. Concretely, we introduce new distributional Bellman operators
for partial observability and prove their convergence under the supremum
p-Wasserstein metric. We also propose a finite representation of these return
distributions via psi-vectors, generalizing the classical alpha-vectors in
POMDP solvers. Building on this, we develop Distributional Point-Based Value
Iteration (DPBVI), which integrates psi-vectors into a standard point-based
backup procedure-bridging DistRL and POMDP planning. By tracking return
distributions, DPBVI naturally enables risk-sensitive control in domains where
rare, high-impact events must be carefully managed. We provide source code to
foster further research in robust decision-making under partial observability.</p>

  and Irregular Plantations</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Weijie Kuang, Hann Woei Ho, Ye Zhou</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-08 06:52:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is vital in precision agriculture to improve
efficiency and resource utilization. In irregular and dispersed plantations,
traditional grid-based CPP often causes redundant coverage over non-vegetated
areas, leading to waste and pollution. To overcome these limitations, we
propose CPP-DIP, a multi-objective CPP framework designed for Micro Air
Vehicles (MAVs). The framework transforms the CPP task into a Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) and optimizes flight paths by minimizing travel
distance, turning angles, and intersection counts. Unlike conventional
approaches, our method does not rely on GPS-based environmental modeling.
Instead, it uses aerial imagery and a Histogram of Oriented Gradients
(HOG)-based approach to detect trees and extract image coordinates. A
density-aware waypoint strategy is applied: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is
used to reduce redundant waypoints in dense regions, while a greedy algorithm
ensures complete coverage in sparse areas. To verify the generality of the
framework, we solve the resulting TSP using three different methods: Greedy
Heuristic Insertion (GHI), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Monte Carlo
Reinforcement Learning (MCRL). Then an object-based optimization is applied to
further refine the resulting path. Additionally, CPP-DIP integrates ForaNav,
our insect-inspired navigation method, for accurate tree localization and
tracking. The experimental results show that MCRL offers a balanced solution,
reducing the travel distance by 16.9 % compared to ACO while maintaining a
similar performance to GHI. It also improves path smoothness by reducing
turning angles by 28.3 % and 59.9 % relative to ACO and GHI, respectively, and
effectively eliminates intersections. These results confirm the robustness and
effectiveness of CPP-DIP in different TSP solvers.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reasoning lies at the heart of intelligence, shaping the ability to make
decisions, draw conclusions, and generalize across domains. In artificial
intelligence, as systems increasingly operate in open, uncertain, and
multimodal environments, reasoning becomes essential for enabling robust and
adaptive behavior. Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) have emerged as a
promising paradigm, integrating modalities such as text, images, audio, and
video to support complex reasoning capabilities and aiming to achieve
comprehensive perception, precise understanding, and deep reasoning. As
research advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular,
perception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer
more coherent cross-modal understanding. While instruction tuning and
reinforcement learning have improved model reasoning, significant challenges
remain in omni-modal generalization, reasoning depth, and agentic behavior. To
address these issues, we present a comprehensive and structured survey of
multimodal reasoning research, organized around a four-stage developmental
roadmap that reflects the field's shifting design philosophies and emerging
capabilities. First, we review early efforts based on task-specific modules,
where reasoning was implicitly embedded across stages of representation,
alignment, and fusion. Next, we examine recent approaches that unify reasoning
into multimodal LLMs, with advances such as Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)
and multimodal reinforcement learning enabling richer and more structured
reasoning chains. Finally, drawing on empirical insights from challenging
benchmarks and experimental cases of OpenAI O3 and O4-mini, we discuss the
conceptual direction of native large multimodal reasoning models (N-LMRMs),
which aim to support scalable, agentic, and adaptive reasoning and planning in
complex, real-world environments.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Fast and effective incident response is essential to prevent adversarial
cyberattacks. Autonomous Cyber Defense (ACD) aims to automate incident response
through Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents that plan and execute actions. Most
ACD approaches focus on single-agent scenarios and leverage Reinforcement
Learning (RL). However, ACD RL-trained agents depend on costly training, and
their reasoning is not always explainable or transferable. Large Language
Models (LLMs) can address these concerns by providing explainable actions in
general security contexts. Researchers have explored LLM agents for ACD but
have not evaluated them on multi-agent scenarios or interacting with other ACD
agents. In this paper, we show the first study on how LLMs perform in
multi-agent ACD environments by proposing a new integration to the CybORG CAGE
4 environment. We examine how ACD teams of LLM and RL agents can interact by
proposing a novel communication protocol. Our results highlight the strengths
and weaknesses of LLMs and RL and help us identify promising research
directions to create, train, and deploy future teams of ACD agents.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Modular self-reconfigurable satellites refer to satellite clusters composed
of individual modular units capable of altering their configurations. The
configuration changes enable the execution of diverse tasks and mission
objectives. Existing path planning algorithms for reconfiguration often suffer
from high computational complexity, poor generalization capability, and limited
support for diverse target configurations. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a goal-oriented reinforcement learning-based path planning

<p class='card-text'>Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based learning approaches for
wireless networks rely on expensive trial-and-error mechanisms and real-time
feedback based on extensive environment interactions, which leads to low data
efficiency and short-sighted policies. These limitations become particularly
problematic in complex, dynamic networks with high uncertainty and long-term
planning requirements. To address these limitations, in this paper, a novel
world model-based learning framework is proposed to minimize
packet-completeness-aware age of information (CAoI) in a vehicular network.
Particularly, a challenging representative scenario is considered pertaining to
a millimeter-wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network,
which is characterized by high mobility, frequent signal blockages, and
extremely short coherence time. Then, a world model framework is proposed to
jointly learn a dynamic model of the mmWave V2X environment and use it to
imagine trajectories for learning how to perform link scheduling. In
particular, the long-term policy is learned in differentiable imagined
trajectories instead of environment interactions. Moreover, owing to its
imagination abilities, the world model can jointly predict time-varying
wireless data and optimize link scheduling in real-world wireless and V2X
networks. Thus, during intervals without actual observations, the world model
remains capable of making efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are
performed on a realistic simulator based on Sionna that integrates
physics-based end-to-end channel modeling, ray-tracing, and scene geometries
with material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model
achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency, and achieves 26%
improvement and 16% improvement in CAoI, respectively, compared to the
model-based RL (MBRL) method and the model-free RL (MFRL) method.</p>

two-stage process. First, we employ PU learning to learn a skill risk predictor

<p class='card-text'>This is a preprint of a review article that has not yet undergone peer
review. The content is intended for early dissemination and academic
discussion. The final version may differ upon formal publication. As the Fourth
Industrial Revolution reshapes industrial paradigms, human-robot collaboration
(HRC) has transitioned from a desirable capability to an operational necessity.
In response, collaborative robots (Cobots) are evolving beyond repetitive tasks
toward adaptive, semantically informed interaction with humans and
environments. This paper surveys five foundational pillars enabling this
transformation: semantic-level perception, cognitive action planning,
explainable learning and control, safety-aware motion design, and multimodal
human intention recognition. We examine the role of semantic mapping in
transforming spatial data into meaningful context, and explore cognitive
planning frameworks that leverage this context for goal-driven decision-making.
Additionally, we analyze explainable reinforcement learning methods, including
policy distillation and attention mechanisms, which enhance interpretability
and trust. Safety is addressed through force-adaptive control and risk-aware
trajectory planning, while seamless human interaction is supported via gaze and
gesture-based intent recognition. Despite these advancements, challenges such
as perception-action disjunction, real-time explainability limitations, and
incomplete human trust persist. To address these, we propose a unified
Cognitive Synergy Architecture, integrating all modules into a cohesive

<p class='card-text'>Efficient path planning in robotics, particularly within large-scale, dynamic
environments, remains a significant hurdle. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited
adaptability in dynamic scenarios hinder real-time deployment on edge devices.
We present SmallPlan -- a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to
train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning
tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate
across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs
are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not
only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them
aware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how
chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance.
However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel
reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a
bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT
that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the
semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the
token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch
generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce
BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes
both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning
strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance
with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE
benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1. Code is available

<p class='card-text'>We introduce Phi-4-reasoning, a 14-billion parameter reasoning model that
achieves strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. Trained via supervised
fine-tuning of Phi-4 on carefully curated set of "teachable" prompts-selected
for the right level of complexity and diversity-and reasoning demonstrations
generated using o3-mini, Phi-4-reasoning generates detailed reasoning chains
that effectively leverage inference-time compute. We further develop
Phi-4-reasoning-plus, a variant enhanced through a short phase of outcome-based
reinforcement learning that offers higher performance by generating longer
reasoning traces. Across a wide range of reasoning tasks, both models
outperform significantly larger open-weight models such as
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B model and approach the performance levels of full
DeepSeek-R1 model. Our comprehensive evaluations span benchmarks in math and
scientific reasoning, coding, algorithmic problem solving, planning, and
spatial understanding. Interestingly, we observe a non-trivial transfer of
improvements to general-purpose benchmarks as well. In this report, we provide
insights into our training data, our training methodologies, and our
evaluations. We show that the benefit of careful data curation for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) extends to reasoning language models, and can be further
amplified by reinforcement learning (RL). Finally, our evaluation points to
opportunities for improving how we assess the performance and robustness of
reasoning models.</p>

  Optimizing Energy-Constrained Cooperative Routing with a DRL Framework</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Efficient mission planning for cooperative systems involving Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) requires addressing energy
constraints, scalability, and coordination challenges between agents. UAVs
excel in rapidly covering large areas but are constrained by limited battery
life, while UGVs, with their extended operational range and capability to serve
as mobile recharging stations, are hindered by slower speeds. This
heterogeneity makes coordination between UAVs and UGVs critical for achieving
optimal mission outcomes. In this work, we propose a scalable deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to address the energy-constrained
cooperative routing problem for multi-agent UAV-UGV teams, aiming to visit a
set of task points in minimal time with UAVs relying on UGVs for recharging
during the mission. The framework incorporates sortie-wise agent switching to
efficiently manage multiple agents, by allocating task points and coordinating
actions. Using an encoder-decoder transformer architecture, it optimizes routes
and recharging rendezvous for the UAV-UGV team in the task scenario. Extensive
computational experiments demonstrate the framework's superior performance over
heuristic methods and a DRL baseline, delivering significant improvements in
solution quality and runtime efficiency across diverse scenarios.
Generalization studies validate its robustness, while dynamic scenario
highlights its adaptability to real-time changes with a case study. This work
advances UAV-UGV cooperative routing by providing a scalable, efficient, and
robust solution for multi-agent mission planning.</p>

  Efficiency-Boosted Mechanical Search</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Yiting Zhang, Shichen Li, Elena Shrestha</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-04-29 17:37:45</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Mechanical search (MS) in cluttered environments remains a significant
challenge for autonomous manipulators, requiring long-horizon planning and
robust state estimation under occlusions and partial observability. In this
work, we introduce XPG-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that enables
agents to efficiently perform MS tasks through explainable, priority-guided
decision-making based on raw sensory inputs. XPG-RL integrates a task-driven
action prioritization mechanism with a learned context-aware switching strategy
that dynamically selects from a discrete set of action primitives such as
target grasping, occlusion removal, and viewpoint adjustment. Within this
strategy, a policy is optimized to output adaptive threshold values that govern
the discrete selection among action primitives. The perception module fuses
RGB-D inputs with semantic and geometric features to produce a structured scene
representation for downstream decision-making. Extensive experiments in both
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that XPG-RL consistently
outperforms baseline methods in task success rates and motion efficiency,
achieving up to 4.5$\times$ higher efficiency in long-horizon tasks. These
results underscore the benefits of integrating domain knowledge with learnable
decision-making policies for robust and efficient robotic manipulation.</p>
