  Wilderness Search and Rescue Planning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Jan-Hendrik Ewers, David Anderson, Douglas Thomson</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-26 17:54:47</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Wilderness search and rescue operations are often carried out over vast
landscapes. The search efforts, however, must be undertaken in minimum time to
maximize the chance of survival of the victim. Whilst the advent of cheap
multicopters in recent years has changed the way search operations are handled,
it has not solved the challenges of the massive areas at hand. The problem
therefore is not one of complete coverage, but one of maximizing the
information gathered in the limited time available. In this work we propose
that a combination of a recurrent autoencoder and deep reinforcement learning
is a more efficient solution to the search problem than previous pure deep
reinforcement learning or optimisation approaches. The autoencoder training
paradigm efficiently maximizes the information throughput of the encoder into
its latent space representation which deep reinforcement learning is primed to
leverage. Without the overhead of independently solving the problem that the
recurrent autoencoder is designed for, it is more efficient in learning the
control task. We further implement three additional architectures for a
comprehensive comparison of the main proposed architecture. Similarly, we apply
both soft actor-critic and proximal policy optimisation to provide an insight
into the performance of both in a highly non-linear and complex application
with a large observation Results show that the proposed architecture is vastly
superior to the benchmarks, with soft actor-critic achieving the best
performance. This model further outperformed work from the literature whilst
having below a fifth of the total learnable parameters and training in a
quarter of the time.</p>

<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Siddharth Singh, Tian Yu, Qing Chang, John Karigiannis, Shaopeng Liu</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-26 17:32:22</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Industrial robots are widely used in diverse manufacturing environments.
Nonetheless, how to enable robots to automatically plan trajectories for
changing tasks presents a considerable challenge. Further complexities arise
when robots operate within work cells alongside machines, humans, or other
robots. This paper introduces a multi-level hybrid robot motion planning method
combining a task space Reinforcement Learning-based Learning from Demonstration
(RL-LfD) agent and a joint-space based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based
agent. A higher level agent learns to switch between the two agents to enable
feasible and smooth motion. The feasibility is computed by incorporating
reachability, joint limits, manipulability, and collision risks of the robot in
the given environment. Therefore, the derived hybrid motion planning policy
generates a feasible trajectory that adheres to task constraints. The
effectiveness of the method is validated through sim ulated robotic scenarios
and in a real-world setup.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-26 16:55:23</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) poses significant challenges due to
the exponential growth of state and action spaces and the non-stationary nature
of multiagent environments. This results in notable sample inefficiency and
hinders generalization across diverse tasks. The complexity is further
pronounced in relational settings, where domain knowledge is crucial but often
underutilized by existing MARL algorithms. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose integrating relational planners as centralized controllers with
efficient state abstractions and reinforcement learning. This approach proves
to be sample-efficient and facilitates effective task transfer and

  Planning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Jaehyeon Son, Soochan Lee, Gunhee Kim</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-26 10:16:57</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Recent studies have shown that Transformers can perform in-context
reinforcement learning (RL) by imitating existing RL algorithms, enabling
sample-efficient adaptation to unseen tasks without parameter updates. However,
these models also inherit the suboptimal behaviors of the RL algorithms they
imitate. This issue primarily arises due to the gradual update rule employed by
those algorithms. Model-based planning offers a promising solution to this
limitation by allowing the models to simulate potential outcomes before taking
action, providing an additional mechanism to deviate from the suboptimal
behavior. Rather than learning a separate dynamics model, we propose
Distillation for In-Context Planning (DICP), an in-context model-based RL
framework where Transformers simultaneously learn environment dynamics and
improve policy in-context. We evaluate DICP across a range of discrete and
continuous environments, including Darkroom variants and Meta-World. Our
results show that DICP achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring
significantly fewer environment interactions than baselines, which include both
model-free counterparts and existing meta-RL methods.</p>

  for Autonomous Parking</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Zhitao Wang, Zhe Chen, Mingyang Jiang, Tong Qin, Ming Yang</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-26 05:32:20</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Autonomous parking has become a critical application in automatic driving
research and development. Parking operations often suffer from limited space
and complex environments, requiring accurate perception and precise
maneuvering. Traditional rule-based parking algorithms struggle to adapt to
diverse and unpredictable conditions, while learning-based algorithms lack
consistent and stable performance in various scenarios. Therefore, a hybrid
approach is necessary that combines the stability of rule-based methods and the
generalizability of learning-based methods. Recently, reinforcement learning
(RL) based policy has shown robust capability in planning tasks. However, the
simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer gap seriously blocks the
real-world deployment. To address these problems, we employ a hybrid policy,
consisting of a rule-based Reeds-Shepp (RS) planner and a learning-based
reinforcement learning (RL) planner. A real-time LiDAR-based Occupancy Grid Map
(OGM) representation is adopted to bridge the sim-to-real gap, leading the
hybrid policy can be applied to real-world systems seamlessly. We conducted
extensive experiments both in the simulation environment and real-world
scenarios, and the result demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms
pure rule-based and learning-based methods. The real-world experiment further
validates the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

  long-horizon prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Haewon Jung, Donguk Lee, Haecheol Park, JunHyeop Kim, Beomjoon Kim</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-25 09:23:52</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Current robots face challenges in manipulation tasks that require a long
sequence of prehensile and non-prehensile skills. This involves handling
contact-rich interactions and chaining multiple skills while considering their
long-term consequences. This paper presents a framework that leverages
imitation learning to distill a planning algorithm, capable of solving
long-horizon problems but requiring extensive computation time, into a policy
for efficient action inference. We introduce $\texttt{Skill-RRT}$, an extension
of the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) that incorporates skill
applicability checks and intermediate object pose sampling for efficient
long-horizon planning. To enable skill chaining, we propose
$\textit{connectors}$, goal-conditioned policies that transition between skills
while minimizing object disturbance. Using lazy planning, connectors are
selectively trained on relevant transitions, reducing the cost of training.
High-quality demonstrations are generated with $\texttt{Skill-RRT}$ and refined
by a noise-based replay mechanism to ensure robust policy performance. The
distilled policy, trained entirely in simulation, zero-shot transfer to the
real world, and achieves over 80% success rates across three challenging
manipulation tasks. In simulation, our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art skill-based reinforcement learning method, $\texttt{MAPLE}$,
and $\texttt{Skill-RRT}$.</p>

<h4 class='card-title'><a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17813v1' target='_blank'>Safe Multi-Agent Navigation guided by Goal-Conditioned Safe
  Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Meng Feng, Viraj Parimi, Brian Williams</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-25 03:38:52</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Safe navigation is essential for autonomous systems operating in hazardous
environments. Traditional planning methods excel at long-horizon tasks but rely
on a predefined graph with fixed distance metrics. In contrast, safe
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors without relying on
manual heuristics but fails to solve long-horizon tasks, particularly in
goal-conditioned and multi-agent scenarios.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel method that integrates the strengths of
both planning and safe RL. Our method leverages goal-conditioned RL and safe RL
to learn a goal-conditioned policy for navigation while concurrently estimating
cumulative distance and safety levels using learned value functions via an
automated self-training algorithm. By constructing a graph with states from the
replay buffer, our method prunes unsafe edges and generates a waypoint-based
plan that the agent follows until reaching its goal, effectively balancing
faster and safer routes over extended distances.
  Utilizing this unified high-level graph and a shared low-level
goal-conditioned safe RL policy, we extend this approach to address the
multi-agent safe navigation problem. In particular, we leverage Conflict-Based
Search (CBS) to create waypoint-based plans for multiple agents allowing for
their safe navigation over extended horizons. This integration enhances the
scalability of goal-conditioned safe RL in multi-agent scenarios, enabling
efficient coordination among agents.
  Extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method in achieving distance goals safely for multiple
agents in complex and hazardous environments. Our code will be released to
support future research.</p>

  design</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Andrew Holliday</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-25 01:24:20</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This thesis concerns the use of reinforcement learning to train neural
networks to aid in the design of public transit networks. The Transit Network
Design Problem (TNDP) is an optimization problem of considerable practical
importance. Given a city with an existing road network and travel demands, the
goal is to find a set of transit routes - each of which is a path through the
graph - that collectively satisfy all demands, while minimizing a cost function
that may depend both on passenger satisfaction and operating costs. The
existing literature on this problem mainly considers metaheuristic optimization
algorithms, such as genetic algorithms and ant-colony optimization. By
contrast, we begin by taking a reinforcement learning approach, formulating the
construction of a set of transit routes as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and
training a neural net policy to act as the agent in this MDP. We then show
that, beyond using this policy to plan a transit network directly, it can be
combined with existing metaheuristic algorithms, both to initialize the
solution and to suggest promising moves at each step of a search through
solution space. We find that such hybrid algorithms, which use a neural policy
trained via reinforcement learning as a core component within a classical
metaheuristic framework, can plan transit networks that are superior to those
planned by either the neural policy or the metaheuristic algorithm. We
demonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to redesign the transit
network for the city of Laval, Quebec, and show that in simulation, the
resulting transit network provides better service at lower cost than the
existing transit network.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advances in multimodal Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) datasets
emphasize the integration of speech and gestures, allowing robots to absorb
explicit knowledge and tacit understanding. However, existing datasets
primarily focus on elementary tasks like object pointing and pushing, limiting
their applicability to complex domains. They prioritize simpler human command
data but place less emphasis on training robots to correctly interpret tasks
and respond appropriately. To address these gaps, we present the NatSGLD
dataset, which was collected using a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) method, where
participants interacted with a robot they believed to be autonomous. NatSGLD
records humans' multimodal commands (speech and gestures), each paired with a
demonstration trajectory and a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula that
provides a ground-truth interpretation of the commanded tasks. This dataset
serves as a foundational resource for research at the intersection of HRI and
machine learning. By providing multimodal inputs and detailed annotations,
NatSGLD enables exploration in areas such as multimodal instruction following,
plan recognition, and human-advisable reinforcement learning from
demonstrations. We release the dataset and code under the MIT License at

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-23 16:20:15</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Planning with options -- a sequence of primitive actions -- has been shown
effective in reinforcement learning within complex environments. Previous
studies have focused on planning with predefined options or learned options
through expert demonstration data. Inspired by MuZero, which learns superhuman
heuristics without any human knowledge, we propose a novel approach, named
OptionZero. OptionZero incorporates an option network into MuZero, providing
autonomous discovery of options through self-play games. Furthermore, we modify
the dynamics network to provide environment transitions when using options,
allowing searching deeper under the same simulation constraints. Empirical
experiments conducted in 26 Atari games demonstrate that OptionZero outperforms
MuZero, achieving a 131.58% improvement in mean human-normalized score. Our
behavior analysis shows that OptionZero not only learns options but also
acquires strategic skills tailored to different game characteristics. Our
findings show promising directions for discovering and using options in

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-23 02:57:06</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)-assisted
Internet of Things (IoT) systems face the following challenges: limited
resources and suboptimal trajectory planning. Reinforcement learning-based
trajectory planning schemes face issues of low search efficiency and learning
instability when optimizing large-scale systems. To address these issues, we
present an Attention-based UAV Trajectory Optimization (AUTO) framework based
on the graph transformer, which consists of an Attention Trajectory
Optimization Model (ATOM) and a Trajectory lEarNing Method based on
Actor-critic (TENMA). In ATOM, a graph encoder is used to calculate the
self-attention characteristics of all IoTDs, and a trajectory decoder is
developed to optimize the number and trajectories of UAVs. TENMA then trains
the ATOM using an improved Actor-Critic method, in which the real reward of the
system is applied as the baseline to reduce variances in the critic network.
This method is suitable for high-quality and large-scale multi-UAV trajectory
planning. Finally, we develop numerous experiments, including a hardware
experiment in the field case, to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the

<p class='card-text'>6G networks aim to achieve global coverage, massive connectivity, and
ultra-stringent requirements. Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGINs) and
Semantic Communication (SemCom) are essential for realizing these goals, yet
they introduce considerable complexity in resource orchestration. Drawing
inspiration from research in robotics, a viable solution to manage this
complexity is the application of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although the use
of LLMs in network orchestration has recently gained attention, existing
solutions have not sufficiently addressed LLM hallucinations or their
adaptation to network dynamics. To address this gap, this paper proposes a
framework called Autonomous Reinforcement Coordination (ARC) for a
SemCom-enabled SAGIN. This framework employs an LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented
Generator (RAG) monitors services, users, and resources and processes the
collected data, while a Hierarchical Action Planner (HAP) orchestrates
resources. ARC decomposes orchestration into two tiers, utilizing LLMs for
high-level planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents for low-level
decision-making, in alignment with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) concept. The
LLMs utilize Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for few-shot learning, empowered
by contrastive learning, while the RL agents employ replay buffer management
for continual learning, thereby achieving efficiency, accuracy, and
adaptability. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of ARC,
along with a comprehensive discussion on potential future research directions
to enhance and upgrade ARC.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Over the last decade, the use of machine learning (ML) approaches in
medicinal applications has increased manifold. Most of these approaches are
based on deep learning, which aims to learn representations from grid data
(like medical images). However, reinforcement learning (RL) applications in
medicine are relatively less explored. Medical applications often involve a
sequence of subtasks that form a diagnostic pipeline, and RL is uniquely suited
to optimize over such sequential decision-making tasks. Ultrasound (US) image
analysis is a quintessential example of such a sequential decision-making task,
where the raw signal captured by the US transducer undergoes a series of signal
processing and image post-processing steps, generally leading to a diagnostic
suggestion. The application of RL in US remains limited. Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL), that combines deep learning and RL, holds great promise in
optimizing these pipelines by enabling intelligent and sequential
decision-making. This review paper surveys the applications of RL in US over
the last decade. We provide a succinct overview of the theoretic framework of
RL and its application in US image processing and review existing work in each
aspect of the image analysis pipeline. A comprehensive search of Scopus
filtered on relevance yielded 14 papers most relevant to this topic. These
papers were further categorized based on their target applications image
classification, image segmentation, image enhancement, video summarization, and
auto navigation and path planning. We also examined the type of RL approach
used in each publication. Finally, we discuss key areas in healthcare where DRL
approaches in US could be used for sequential decision-making. We analyze the
opportunities, challenges, and limitations, providing insights into the future

<p class='card-text'>A long-standing goal in AI is to build agents that can solve a variety of
tasks across different environments, including previously unseen ones. Two
dominant approaches tackle this challenge: (i) reinforcement learning (RL),
which learns policies through trial and error, and (ii) optimal control, which
plans actions using a learned or known dynamics model. However, their relative
strengths and weaknesses remain underexplored in the setting where agents must
learn from offline trajectories without reward annotations. In this work, we
systematically analyze the performance of different RL and control-based
methods under datasets of varying quality. On the RL side, we consider
goal-conditioned and zero-shot approaches. On the control side, we train a
latent dynamics model using the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)
and use it for planning. We study how dataset properties-such as data
diversity, trajectory quality, and environment variability-affect the
performance of these approaches. Our results show that model-free RL excels
when abundant, high-quality data is available, while model-based planning
excels in generalization to novel environment layouts, trajectory stitching,
and data-efficiency. Notably, planning with a latent dynamics model emerges as
a promising approach for zero-shot generalization from suboptimal data.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Deep reinforcement learning agents often face challenges to effectively
coordinate perception and decision-making components, particularly in
environments with high-dimensional sensory inputs where feature relevance
varies. This work introduces SPRIG (Stackelberg Perception-Reinforcement
learning with Internal Game dynamics), a framework that models the internal
perception-policy interaction within a single agent as a cooperative
Stackelberg game. In SPRIG, the perception module acts as a leader,
strategically processing raw sensory states, while the policy module follows,
making decisions based on extracted features. SPRIG provides theoretical
guarantees through a modified Bellman operator while preserving the benefits of
modern policy optimization. Experimental results on the Atari BeamRider
environment demonstrate SPRIG's effectiveness, achieving around 30% higher

solar photovoltaic integration and optimization of distribution networks. This
paper reviews scheduling-based and real-time optimization methods for
controlling HPs with a focus on energy flexibility in distribution networks.
Scheduling-based methods fall into two categories: rule-based controllers
(RBCs), which rely on predefined control rules without explicitly seeking
optimal solutions, and optimization models, which are designed to determine the
optimal scheduling of operations. Real-time optimization is achieved through
model predictive control (MPC), which relies on a predictive model to optimize
decisions over a time horizon, and reinforcement learning (RL), which takes a
model-free approach by learning optimal strategies through direct interaction
with the environment. The paper also examines studies on the impact of HPs on
distribution networks, particularly those leveraging energy flexibility
strategies. Key takeaways suggest the need to validate control strategies for
extreme cold-weather regions that require backup heaters, as well as develop
approaches designed for demand charge schemes that integrate HPs with other
controllable loads. From a grid impact assessment perspective, studies have
focused primarily on RBCs for providing energy flexibility through HP
operation, without addressing more advanced methods such as real-time
optimization using MPC or RL-based algorithms. Incorporating these advanced
control strategies could help identify key limitations, including the impact of
varying user participation levels and the cost-benefit trade-offs associated
with their implementation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>It is popular lately to train large language models to be used as chat
assistants, but in the conversation between the user and the chat assistant,
there are prompts, require multi-turns between the chat assistant and the user.
However, there are a number of issues with the multi-turns conversation: The
response of the chat assistant is prone to errors and can't help users achieve
their goals, and as the number of conversation turns increases, the probability
of errors will also increase; It is difficult for chat assistant to generate
responses with different processes based on actual needs for the same prompt;
Chat assistant require the use of tools, but the current approach is not
elegant and efficient, and the number of tool calls is limited. The main reason
for these issues is that large language models don't have the thinking ability
as a human, lack the reasoning ability and planning ability, and lack the
ability to execute plans. To solve these issues, we propose a thinking method
based on a built-in chain of thought: In the multi-turns conversation, for each
user prompt, the large language model thinks based on elements such as chat
history, thinking context, action calls, memory and knowledge, makes detailed
reasoning and planning, and actions according to the plan. We also explored how
the large language model enhances thinking ability through this thinking
method: Collect training datasets according to the thinking method and fine
tune the large language model through supervised learning; Train a consistency
reward model and use it as a reward function to fine tune the large language
model using reinforcement learning, and the reinforced large language model
outputs according to this way of thinking. Our experimental results show that
the reasoning ability and planning ability of the large language model are
enhanced, and the issues in the multi-turns conversation are solved.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The efficient planning of stacking boxes, especially in the online setting
where the sequence of item arrivals is unpredictable, remains a critical
challenge in modern warehouse and logistics management. Existing solutions
often address box size variations, but overlook their intrinsic and physical
properties, such as density and rigidity, which are crucial for real-world
applications. We use reinforcement learning (RL) to solve this problem by
employing action space masking to direct the RL policy toward valid actions.
Unlike previous methods that rely on heuristic stability assessments which are
difficult to assess in physical scenarios, our framework utilizes online
learning to dynamically train the action space mask, eliminating the need for
manual heuristic design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, we deploy our
learned task planner in a real-world robotic palletizer, validating its
practical applicability in operational settings.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recently, there has been growing interest in leveraging large language models
(LLMs) to generate symbolic world models from textual descriptions. Although
LLMs have been extensively explored in the context of world modeling, prior
studies encountered several challenges, including evaluation randomness,
dependence on indirect metrics, and a limited domain scope. To address these
limitations, we introduce a novel benchmark, Text2World, based on planning
domain definition language (PDDL), featuring hundreds of diverse domains and
employing multi-criteria, execution-based metrics for a more robust evaluation.
We benchmark current LLMs using Text2World and find that reasoning models
trained with large-scale reinforcement learning outperform others. However,
even the best-performing model still demonstrates limited capabilities in world
modeling. Building on these insights, we examine several promising strategies
to enhance the world modeling capabilities of LLMs, including test-time
scaling, agent training, and more. We hope that Text2World can serve as a
crucial resource, laying the groundwork for future research in leveraging LLMs
as world models. The project page is available at
