<p class='card-text'>Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) can
enhance autonomous driving (AD) performance in complex scenarios. However,
current LLM-Dominated RL methods over-rely on LLM outputs, which are prone to
hallucinations.Evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM indicates a
non-hallucination rate of only approximately 57.95% when assessed on essential
driving-related tasks. Thus, in these methods, hallucinations from the LLM can
directly jeopardize the performance of driving policies. This paper argues that
maintaining relative independence between the LLM and the RL is vital for
solving the hallucinations problem. Consequently, this paper is devoted to
propose a novel LLM-Hinted RL paradigm. The LLM is used to generate semantic
hints for state augmentation and policy optimization to assist RL agent in
motion planning, while the RL agent counteracts potential erroneous semantic
indications through policy learning to achieve excellent driving performance.
Based on this paradigm, we propose the HCRMP (LLM-Hinted Contextual
Reinforcement Learning Motion Planner) architecture, which is designed that
includes Augmented Semantic Representation Module to extend state space.
Contextual Stability Anchor Module enhances the reliability of multi-critic
weight hints by utilizing information from the knowledge base. Semantic Cache
Module is employed to seamlessly integrate LLM low-frequency guidance with RL
high-frequency control. Extensive experiments in CARLA validate HCRMP's strong
overall driving performance. HCRMP achieves a task success rate of up to 80.3%
under diverse driving conditions with different traffic densities. Under
safety-critical driving conditions, HCRMP significantly reduces the collision
rate by 11.4%, which effectively improves the driving performance in complex
scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Continuous time systems are often modeled using discrete time dynamics but
this requires a small simulation step to maintain accuracy. In turn, this
requires a large planning horizon which leads to computationally demanding
planning problems and reduced performance. Previous work in model free
reinforcement learning has partially addressed this issue using action repeats
where a policy is learned to determine a discrete action duration. Instead we
propose to control the continuous decision timescale directly by using
temporally-extended actions and letting the planner treat the duration of the
action as an additional optimization variable along with the standard action
variables. This additional structure has multiple advantages. It speeds up
simulation time of trajectories and, importantly, it allows for deep horizon
search in terms of primitive actions while using a shallow search depth in the
planner. In addition, in the model based reinforcement learning (MBRL) setting,
it reduces compounding errors from model learning and improves training time
for models. We show that this idea is effective and that the range for action
durations can be automatically selected using a multi-armed bandit formulation
and integrated into the MBRL framework. An extensive experimental evaluation
both in planning and in MBRL, shows that our approach yields faster planning,
better solutions, and that it enables solutions to problems that are not solved
in the standard formulation.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Large language models (LLMs) can transform education, but their optimization
for direct question-answering often undermines effective pedagogy which
requires strategically withholding answers. To mitigate this, we propose an
online reinforcement learning (RL)-based alignment framework that can quickly
adapt LLMs into effective tutors using simulated student-tutor interactions by
emphasizing pedagogical quality and guided problem-solving over simply giving
away answers. We use our method to train a 7B parameter tutor model without
human annotations which reaches similar performance to larger proprietary
models like LearnLM. We introduce a controllable reward weighting to balance
pedagogical support and student solving accuracy, allowing us to trace the
Pareto frontier between these two objectives. Our models better preserve
reasoning capabilities than single-turn SFT baselines and can optionally
enhance interpretability through thinking tags that expose the model's
instructional planning.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Playing video games requires perception, memory, and planning, exactly the
faculties modern large language model (LLM) agents are expected to master. We
study the major challenges in using popular video games to evaluate modern LLMs
and find that directly dropping LLMs into games cannot make an effective
evaluation, for three reasons -- brittle vision perception, prompt sensitivity,
and potential data contamination. We introduce lmgame-Bench to turn games into
reliable evaluations. lmgame-Bench features a suite of platformer, puzzle, and
narrative games delivered through a unified Gym-style API and paired with
lightweight perception and memory scaffolds, and is designed to stabilize
prompt variance and remove contamination. Across 13 leading models, we show
lmgame-Bench is challenging while still separating models well. Correlation
analysis shows that every game probes a unique blend of capabilities often
tested in isolation elsewhere. More interestingly, performing reinforcement
learning on a single game from lmgame-Bench transfers both to unseen games and
to external planning tasks. Our evaluation code is available at

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large
language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in
domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing
RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training
problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they
remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on
heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To
address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an
automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy
concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates
curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating
each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual
arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy
measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum
policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using
the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive
reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly
improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to
harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves
better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning
domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL
fine-tuning of LLMs.</p>

  Planning</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-20 14:45:16</h6>
<p class='card-text'>This paper introduces a novel semantics-aware inspection planning policy
derived through deep reinforcement learning. Reflecting the fact that within
autonomous informative path planning missions in unknown environments, it is
often only a sparse set of objects of interest that need to be inspected, the
method contributes an end-to-end policy that simultaneously performs semantic
object visual inspection combined with collision-free navigation. Assuming
access only to the instantaneous depth map, the associated segmentation image,
the ego-centric local occupancy, and the history of past positions in the
robot's neighborhood, the method demonstrates robust generalizability and
successful crossing of the sim2real gap. Beyond simulations and extensive
comparison studies, the approach is verified in experimental evaluations
onboard a flying robot deployed in novel environments with previously unseen
semantics and overall geometric configurations.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and task planning
capabilities but remain fundamentally limited in physical interaction modeling.
Existing approaches integrate perception via Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or
adaptive decision-making through Reinforcement Learning (RL), but they fail to
capture dynamic object interactions or require task-specific training, limiting
their real-world applicability. We introduce APEX (Anticipatory
Physics-Enhanced Execution), a framework that equips LLMs with physics-driven
foresight for real-time task planning. APEX constructs structured graphs to
identify and model the most relevant dynamic interactions in the environment,
providing LLMs with explicit physical state updates. Simultaneously, APEX
provides low-latency forward simulations of physically feasible actions,
allowing LLMs to select optimal strategies based on predictive outcomes rather
than static observations. We evaluate APEX on three benchmarks designed to
assess perception, prediction, and decision-making: (1) Physics Reasoning
Benchmark, testing causal inference and object motion prediction; (2) Tetris,
evaluating whether physics-informed prediction enhances decision-making
performance in long-horizon planning tasks; (3) Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance,
assessing the immediate integration of perception and action feasibility
analysis. APEX significantly outperforms standard LLMs and VLM-based models,
demonstrating the necessity of explicit physics reasoning for bridging the gap
between language-based intelligence and real-world task execution. The source

<p class='card-text'>Achieving coordinated teamwork among legged robots requires both fine-grained
locomotion control and long-horizon strategic decision-making. Robot soccer
offers a compelling testbed for this challenge, combining dynamic, competitive,
and multi-agent interactions. In this work, we present a hierarchical
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables fully
autonomous and decentralized quadruped robot soccer. First, a set of highly
dynamic low-level skills is trained for legged locomotion and ball
manipulation, such as walking, dribbling, and kicking. On top of these, a
high-level strategic planning policy is trained with Multi-Agent Proximal
Policy Optimization (MAPPO) via Fictitious Self-Play (FSP). This learning
framework allows agents to adapt to diverse opponent strategies and gives rise
to sophisticated team behaviors, including coordinated passing, interception,
and dynamic role allocation. With an extensive ablation study, the proposed
learning method shows significant advantages in the cooperative and competitive
multi-agent soccer game. We deploy the learned policies to real quadruped
robots relying solely on onboard proprioception and decentralized localization,
with the resulting system supporting autonomous robot-robot and robot-human
soccer matches on indoor and outdoor soccer courts.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The selection of base station sites is a critical challenge in 5G network
planning, which requires efficient optimization of coverage, cost, user
satisfaction, and practical constraints. Traditional manual methods, reliant on
human expertise, suffer from inefficiencies and are limited to an unsatisfied
planning-construction consistency. Existing AI tools, despite improving
efficiency in certain aspects, still struggle to meet the dynamic network
conditions and multi-objective needs of telecom operators' networks. To address
these challenges, we propose TelePlanNet, an AI-driven framework tailored for
the selection of base station sites, integrating a three-layer architecture for
efficient planning and large-scale automation. By leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for real-time user input processing and intent alignment with
base station planning, combined with training the planning model using the
improved group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning, the
proposed TelePlanNet can effectively address multi-objective optimization,
evaluates candidate sites, and delivers practical solutions. Experiments
results show that the proposed TelePlanNet can improve the consistency to 78%,
which is superior to the manual methods, providing telecom operators with an
efficient and scalable tool that significantly advances cellular network

  Temporal Planning Guidance using Reinforcement Learning</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Irene Brugnara, Alessandro Valentini, Andrea Micheli</h6>
<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-05-19 17:19:13</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Recent work investigated the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the
synthesis of heuristic guidance to improve the performance of temporal planners
when a domain is fixed and a set of training problems (not plans) is given. The
idea is to extract a heuristic from the value function of a particular
(possibly infinite-state) MDP constructed over the training problems.
  In this paper, we propose an evolution of this learning and planning
framework that focuses on exploiting the information provided by symbolic
heuristics during both the RL and planning phases. First, we formalize
different reward schemata for the synthesis and use symbolic heuristics to
mitigate the problems caused by the truncation of episodes needed to deal with
the potentially infinite MDP. Second, we propose learning a residual of an
existing symbolic heuristic, which is a "correction" of the heuristic value,
instead of eagerly learning the whole heuristic from scratch. Finally, we use
the learned heuristic in combination with a symbolic heuristic using a
multiple-queue planning approach to balance systematic search with imperfect
learned information. We experimentally compare all the approaches, highlighting
their strengths and weaknesses and significantly advancing the state of the art
for this planning and learning schema.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Early cavemen relied on gestures, vocalizations, and simple signals to
coordinate, plan, avoid predators, and share resources. Today, humans
collaborate using complex languages to achieve remarkable results. What drives
this evolution in communication? How does language emerge, adapt, and become
vital for teamwork? Understanding the origins of language remains a challenge.
A leading hypothesis in linguistics and anthropology posits that language
evolved to meet the ecological and social demands of early human cooperation.
Language did not arise in isolation, but through shared survival goals.
Inspired by this view, we investigate the emergence of language in multi-agent
Foraging Games. These environments are designed to reflect the cognitive and
ecological constraints believed to have influenced the evolution of
communication. Agents operate in a shared grid world with only partial
knowledge about other agents and the environment, and must coordinate to
complete games like picking up high-value targets or executing temporally
ordered actions. Using end-to-end deep reinforcement learning, agents learn
both actions and communication strategies from scratch. We find that agents
develop communication protocols with hallmark features of natural language:
arbitrariness, interchangeability, displacement, cultural transmission, and
compositionality. We quantify each property and analyze how different factors,
such as population size and temporal dependencies, shape specific aspects of
the emergent language. Our framework serves as a platform for studying how
language can evolve from partial observability, temporal reasoning, and
cooperative goals in embodied multi-agent settings. We will release all data,

<p class='card-text'>Object-goal navigation (ON) enables autonomous robots to locate and reach
user-specified objects in previously unknown environments, offering promising
applications in domains such as assistive care and disaster response. Existing
ON methods -- including training-free approaches, reinforcement learning, and
zero-shot planners -- generally depend on active exploration to identify
landmark objects (e.g., kitchens or desks), followed by navigation toward
semantically related targets (e.g., a specific mug). However, these methods
often lack strategic planning and do not adequately address trade-offs among
multiple objectives. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework
that formulates ON as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOO), balancing
frontier-based knowledge exploration with knowledge exploitation over
previously observed landmarks; we call this framework MOON (MOO-driven ON). We
implement a prototype MOON system that integrates three key components: (1)
building on QOM [IROS05], a classical ON system that compactly and
discriminatively encodes landmarks based on their semantic relevance to the
target; (2) integrating StructNav [RSS23], a recently proposed training-free
planner, to enhance the navigation pipeline; and (3) introducing a
variable-horizon set orienteering problem formulation to enable global
optimization over both exploration and exploitation strategies. This work
represents an important first step toward developing globally optimized,
next-generation object-goal navigation systems.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Robot learning in high-dimensional control settings, such as humanoid
locomotion, presents persistent challenges for reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms due to unstable dynamics, complex contact interactions, and
sensitivity to distributional shifts during training. Model-based methods,
\textit{e.g.}, Temporal-Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC), have
demonstrated promising results by combining short-horizon planning with
value-based learning, enabling efficient solutions for basic locomotion tasks.
However, these approaches remain ineffective in addressing policy mismatch and
instability introduced by off-policy updates. Thus, in this work, we introduce
Temporal-Difference Group Relative Policy Constraint (TD-GRPC), an extension of
the TD-MPC framework that unifies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with explicit Policy Constraints (PC). TD-GRPC applies a trust-region
constraint in the latent policy space to maintain consistency between the
planning priors and learned rollouts, while leveraging group-relative ranking
to assess and preserve the physical feasibility of candidate trajectories.
Unlike prior methods, TD-GRPC achieves robust motions without modifying the
underlying planner, enabling flexible planning and policy learning. We validate
our method across a locomotion task suite ranging from basic walking to highly
dynamic movements on the 26-DoF Unitree H1-2 humanoid robot. Through simulation
results, TD-GRPC demonstrates its improvements in stability and policy
robustness with sampling efficiency while training for complex humanoid control

<p class='card-text'>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in complex decision-making tasks. This progress raises a natural
question: how do these artificial systems compare to biological agents, which
have been shaped by millions of years of evolution? To help answer this
question, we undertake a comparative study of biological mice and RL agents in
a predator-avoidance maze environment. Through this analysis, we identify a
striking disparity: RL agents consistently demonstrate a lack of
self-preservation instinct, readily risking ``death'' for marginal efficiency
gains. These risk-taking strategies are in contrast to biological agents, which
exhibit sophisticated risk-assessment and avoidance behaviors. Towards bridging
this gap between the biological and artificial, we propose two novel mechanisms
that encourage more naturalistic risk-avoidance behaviors in RL agents. Our
approach leads to the emergence of naturalistic behaviors, including strategic

<p class='card-text'>Multi-step planning has been widely employed to enhance the performance of
large language models (LLMs) on downstream natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, which decomposes the original task into multiple subtasks and guide LLMs
to solve them sequentially without additional training. When addressing task
instances, existing methods either preset the order of steps or attempt
multiple paths at each step. However, these methods overlook instances'
linguistic features and rely on the intrinsic planning capabilities of LLMs to
evaluate intermediate feedback and then select subtasks, resulting in
suboptimal outcomes. To better solve multi-step NLP tasks with LLMs, in this
paper we propose a Reinforcement Learning enhanced Adaptive Planning framework
(RLAP). In our framework, we model an NLP task as a Markov decision process
(MDP) and employ an LLM directly into the environment. In particular, a
lightweight Actor model is trained to estimate Q-values for natural language
sequences consisting of states and actions through reinforcement learning.
Therefore, during sequential planning, the linguistic features of each sequence
in the MDP can be taken into account, and the Actor model interacts with the
LLM to determine the optimal order of subtasks for each task instance. We apply
RLAP on three different types of NLP tasks and conduct extensive experiments on
multiple datasets to verify RLAP's effectiveness and robustness.</p>

<p class='card-text'>When tackling complex problems, humans naturally break them down into
smaller, manageable subtasks and adjust their initial plans based on
observations. For instance, if you want to make coffee at a friend's place, you
might initially plan to grab coffee beans, go to the coffee machine, and pour
them into the machine. Upon noticing that the machine is full, you would skip
the initial steps and proceed directly to brewing. In stark contrast, state of
the art reinforcement learners, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO),
lack such prior knowledge and therefore require significantly more training
steps to exhibit comparable adaptive behavior. Thus, a central research
question arises: \textit{How can we enable reinforcement learning (RL) agents
to have similar ``human priors'', allowing the agent to learn with fewer
training interactions?} To address this challenge, we propose differentiable
symbolic planner (Dylan), a novel framework that integrates symbolic planning
into Reinforcement Learning. Dylan serves as a reward model that dynamically
shapes rewards by leveraging human priors, guiding agents through intermediate
subtasks, thus enabling more efficient exploration. Beyond reward shaping,
Dylan can work as a high level planner that composes primitive policies to
generate new behaviors while avoiding common symbolic planner pitfalls such as
infinite execution loops. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that Dylan
significantly improves RL agents' performance and facilitates generalization to
unseen tasks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have substantially enhanced machine reasoning across diverse
tasks. However, these models predominantly rely on pure text as the medium for
both expressing and structuring reasoning, even when visual information is
present. In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most
natural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving
spatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new
paradigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual
representations, independent of text. In this paradigm, planning is executed
via sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual
domain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a
novel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement
Learning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models,
leading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of
representative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our
visual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct
reasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a
viable and promising alternative to language-based reasoning, opening new
avenues for tasks that benefit from intuitive, image-based inference.</p>

  Aerial Combat Tactics</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping strategic planning, with
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) enabling coordination among
autonomous agents in complex scenarios. However, its practical deployment in
sensitive military contexts is constrained by the lack of explainability, which
is an essential factor for trust, safety, and alignment with human strategies.
This work reviews and assesses current advances in explainability methods for
MARL with a focus on simulated air combat scenarios. We proceed by adapting
various explainability techniques to different aerial combat scenarios to gain
explanatory insights about the model behavior. By linking AI-generated tactics
with human-understandable reasoning, we emphasize the need for transparency to
ensure reliable deployment and meaningful human-machine interaction. By
illuminating the crucial importance of explainability in advancing MARL for
operational defense, our work supports not only strategic planning but also the
training of military personnel with insightful and comprehensible analyses.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Diffusion models have recently gained prominence in offline reinforcement
learning due to their ability to effectively learn high-performing,
generalizable policies from static datasets. Diffusion-based planners
facilitate long-horizon decision-making by generating high-quality trajectories
through iterative denoising, guided by return-maximizing objectives. However,
existing guided sampling strategies such as Classifier Guidance,
Classifier-Free Guidance, and Monte Carlo Sample Selection either produce
suboptimal multi-modal actions, struggle with distributional drift, or incur
prohibitive inference-time costs. To address these challenges, we propose Prior
Guidance (PG), a novel guided sampling framework that replaces the standard
Gaussian prior of a behavior-cloned diffusion model with a learnable
distribution, optimized via a behavior-regularized objective. PG directly
generates high-value trajectories without costly reward optimization of the
diffusion model itself, and eliminates the need to sample multiple candidates
at inference for sample selection. We present an efficient training strategy
that applies behavior regularization in latent space, and empirically
demonstrate that PG outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies and
planners across diverse long-horizon offline RL benchmarks.</p>
